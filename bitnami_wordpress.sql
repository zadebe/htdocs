In addition, the Gutenberg team has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\">a comprehensive guide</a> to the features currently included in the editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Users can test Gutenberg right now by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">the plugin</a>, which currently has over 450,000 active installs according to the new <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\">Gutenberg in Numbers</a> site. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg? Follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/\">the #gutenberg tag on the Core team blog</a> and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Work Begins on WordPress 5.0</h2>\n\n<p>After initially announcing a minor v4.9.9 release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/28/dev-chat-summary-september-26th-4-9-9-week-7/\">the Core team has shifted their focus to the next major release</a> — v5.0. One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed.

While this was a maintenance release fixing 46 bugs, it was significant for Core development because it made a point of highlighting Gutenberg — the new WordPress editor that is currently in development (more on that below).<br /></p>\n\n<p>This release also included some important updates to the privacy tools that were added to Core earlier this year.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

Two weeks ago, Matthew MacPherson, who was named WordPress 5.0&#8217;s new accessibility lead, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposed the audit</a> and agreed to it being performed by an independent third party. The audit had gained strong support among accessibility contributors and others following the ticket.</p>\n<p>After soliciting detailed proposals from four companies, MacPherson has since rescinded the offer to coordinate the audit at this time and it seems he was unaware that he didn&#8217;t have the authority to authorize it in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For at least the time being, Automattic has decided to forgo conducting an Accessibility audit on Gutenberg,&#8221; MacPherson said. He cited the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;an audit will not be actionable given our release timeline, because…</li>\n<li>the audit will not affect release timing, so&#8230;</li>\n<li>it would be more prudent to explore an audit on a less rushed timeline in the future&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>MacPherson apologized for &#8220;getting hopes up and then failing the community&#8221; on this particular issue. He is supportive of getting an audit but it is not a priority to complete before Gutenberg&#8217;s merge proposal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful we&#8217;ll explore an audit going forward, but unfortunately it will not happen before the merge proposal and thus I&#8217;m closing this issue as a won&#8217;t fix,&#8221; MacPherson said. &#8220;I would still like to blog about the state of Gutenberg accessibility, both the good and the bad. We&#8217;re making some improvements to keyboard navigation, color contrast, focus behavior, and date/color-pickers just this week.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those following the ticket were disappointed in the decision and several heated replies have been hidden and/or moderated. The issue has since been locked and unlocked several times since the announcement that Automattic has decided to forgo the audit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Literally every person with disabilities who has tested Gutenberg, both recently and at the outset, has flagged blocking issues as to why it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; Accessibility team member Amanda Rush said. &#8220;And user testing is just as important to accessibility as is WCAG 2.0 level AA compliance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because MacPherson said the decision came from Automattic, dissidents on the other side of the issue are saying that the company is acting in its own interests, as the decision was delivered without much explanation beyond an audit not fitting into Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gutenberg appears to be a commercially-driven add-on primarily intended for a8c’s benefit and should probably be treated as such by the community wherever that isn’t already true. <a href=\"https://t.co/c3yFImB5XL\">pic.twitter.com/c3yFImB5XL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Another Day, Another Doug (@zamoose) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zamoose/status/1052033672952598528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So disappointed in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/automattic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@automattic</a>’s decision to forego an independent accessibility audit for Gutenberg.

I plan to be an advocate, but I don&#8217;t set the timelines and I also don&#8217;t have solid data around accessibility. That&#8217;s the point of the audit: so we can speak from a place of hard data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An independent accessibility audit would have revealed whether the team&#8217;s current perceptions of Gutenberg&#8217;s lack of accessibility are accurate or inflated. It would also give the team&#8217;s new leadership the data he needs in order to make the most accurate recommendations regarding its readiness for the world. Kevin Hoffman advocated for pushing on with the audit regardless, in case WordPress 5.0 comes on a later timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The January 22, 2019 date would allow more than three months between today and the release of 5.0 to complete an audit and take action,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;The reasons above suggest that we cannot get an audit completed and significantly improve accessibility in three months time. If true, that is all the more reason to start the process now and respond to the audit by fixing as many issues as we can before 5.0 releases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that the timeline will become less rushed after 5.0 (when it&#8217;s in the hands of real-world users who need it most) makes no sense at all.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As a blind <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> user &amp; sometime dev I really appreciate your work &amp; it is a real tragedy that the leaders of WordPress &amp; this project didn\'t build in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#a11y</a> from the very beginning &#8211; Any good team knows it is much harder to fix in hindsight</p>\n<p>&mdash; Dale Reardon (@DaleReardon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaleReardon/status/1049640723887185925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Absolutely this.

WordPress has always tried to get most of the way there on accessibility by sticking to common patterns and semantics, with the difference covered by key efforts of volunteers everyone on the Accessibility team doing testing and filing actionable bug reports. Gutenberg&#8217;s move to being an entirely JavaScript-based application has made it harder to apply those patterns, but we can work together to establish new patterns, a new baseline.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although there is no precedent for it, in this instance where Automattic&#8217;s perception of the editor&#8217;s accessibility differs wildly from that of the community, an outside audit might mitigate some of the conflict surrounding the issue.</p>\n<p>Pendergast said that despite best intentions and prioritizing accessibility, there is a possibility the Gutenberg team may not be able to deliver an &#8220;acceptable UX for assistive technology users by the time 5.0 is released.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;Despite the best intentions of everyone on the Gutenberg team, we haven&#8217;t done enough. I can honestly say that accessibility has always been a priority, but it hasn&#8217;t been a high enough priority, and we&#8217;ve done a poor job of communicating where accessibility has been improved. I mentioned some of those improvements in my earlier comment, but those improvements are of no benefit if we haven&#8217;t hit the baseline accessible experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The challenge of building in accessibility at the design stage, instead of retrofitting it after the fact, is one that WordPress is still struggling to get right in the Gutenberg era. Accessibility experts with React skills are few and far between, so it&#8217;s not easy to get fixes for all the issues testers are finding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some meetings we’ve discussed how to make accessibility integrated in the design process (design in its broader sense) since the beginning,&#8221; Accessibility specialist Andrea Fercia said during the team&#8217;s most recent meeting on Slack. &#8220;This is certainly an area were our communication and knowledge sharing should improve.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:16:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: First Look at The Twenty Nineteen Default Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84808\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-nineteen-default-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2283:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.allancole.com/\">Allan Cole</a>, a WordPress Theme Imagineer at Automattic has published the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/\">first glimpses</a> of the Twenty Nineteen default theme slated to ship with WordPress 5.0.

Twenty Nineteen doesn&#8217;t have a sidebar but will have an area in the footer to display widgets.</p>\n\n<p>The theme will have full compatibility with Gutenberg when it&#8217;s released. It will also contain Front-end and Back-end editor styles. This will allow the presentation of content in the back-end to closely resemble how the finished product will look like. </p>\n\n<p>Twenty Nineteen is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/\">Underscores</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-starter-theme\">Gutenberg starter themes</a>. SASS is used to keep styles in-sync between Gutenberg and the front-end experience which Cole notes is, &#8220;not usual for a default theme and open to debate.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>With WordPress 5.0 scheduled for a November release, Twenty Nineteen is on a fast track development cycle. A release candidate is expected to be available at the end of this month. </p>\n\n<p>To keep tabs on development, you can monitor the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen\">project&#8217;s GitHub page</a>.

ACF Blocks is a feature aimed at PHP developers who have not taken the deep dive into JavaScript yet. It essentially offers a shortcut to creating custom blocks using PHP and HTML instead of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that ACF Blocks is one of the more important features ever added to our plugin,&#8221; ACF representative Eric Karkovack said. &#8220;It levels the playing field and allows more developers to take advantage of Gutenberg’s key feature.&#8221; The feature was designed to allow WordPress developers who use ACF to maintain their current workflow for extending the editor.</p>\n<p>ACF Blocks allows developers to register a custom block type from a functions.php file. From there they can create a field group and use any ACF fields in the block. Rendering the block is the same process that&#8217;s used for displaying custom fields, with the notable addition of wrapping the HTML + PHP in a function.</p>\n<p>The ACF team plans to include the new blocks feature in version 5.8, which is anticipated to arrive in November.</p>\n<p>Creating custom blocks in this way seems like a stopgap measure for developers who haven&#8217;t had the time to learn how to extend Gutenberg before WordPress 5.0 arrives. This feature may be a useful abstraction for those who need to maintain their current workflow with ACF but it postpones the inevitable for developers who want to be truly proficient at extending the new editor. JavaScript skills will be required to properly understand what is going on under the hood.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:05:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Matt: The Importance of Meeting In-Person\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://ma.tt/2018/10/the-importance-of-meeting-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4239:\"<p>I recently returned from Orlando where Automattic hosted its annual Grand Meetup where nearly all of our 800 employees from around the world, spend a week together in the same place.

They plan to examine specific requirements once that information is available and will assist site owners in reaching compliance.</p>\n<h3>New Privacy Working Group to Facilitate Collaboration across Open Source Communities</h3>\n<p>At Drupal Europe 2018 a group of WordPress and Drupal contributors met to discuss the possibility of welcoming teams from major open source projects to work together on shared concerns. WordPress Privacy team contributor Heather Burns attended the first test run of the working group in the Open Source Lounge at the conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the working group we have the big three &#8211; Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla &#8211; and we also spoke with representatives from the smaller projects like Neos and Typo3,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We&#8217;re all dealing with similar issues but from different approaches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burns said one of the goals of the working group is to push the idea forward that privacy is a common, positive, proactive value which can be taught and shared across projects. Members will discussion questions like whether privacy fixes belong in core or modules, how privacy notices pull information from different plugins and modules, and what laws are coming up that would require open source CMSs to build in some functionality in advance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way of pooling resources, code libraries, and briefings, as well as giving us a forum to share experiences,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;For example, we&#8217;re going to arrange for Drupal&#8217;s privacy lead to give a live video demo of their GDPR tools to our core group, and we&#8217;re going to do the same for them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The privacy working group is being set up through the Drupal community structure and members are in the process of coordinating some funding. More information on funding will be available in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Privacy Contributors Seek to Change the Perception of Privacy to a Positive, Proactive Value</h3>\n<p>In addition to collaborating across the broader open source community, the privacy working group endeavors to educate their communities on the inherent value of privacy instead of simply focusing on the consequences of companies being forced to pay a fee if they don&#8217;t meet legal obligations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very keen to also shift the perception of what privacy is, and that it&#8217;s not just seen as being about negative legal obligations for GDPR, CCPA, etc.,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We want people to think of privacy like accessibility: just the right thing to do for user protection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burns speaks about privacy at WordPress and Drupal conferences and how projects can have differing cultural, historical, and legal approaches to privacy. Cultural barriers to the recognition of privacy as a core value is one of the privacy team&#8217;s biggest challenges in advocating contributions that respect and protect users&#8217; rights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m proudest of this year is helping people to understand each other better,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;We all come to the table assuming we share the same cultural, historical, and legal views of what privacy means and what role it should play, when the truth is there are wildly different views held even within project teams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To paraphrase that awful quote, we don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know. What I do is help people to understand where we&#8217;re all coming from and what we don&#8217;t actually know. From there, I define what a healthy approach to privacy should involve outside reactive legal obligations, using a methodology derived from a number of international frameworks and treaties on privacy. It&#8217;s a matter of inspiring people to realize that as open source project contributors, we are people of enormous power and influence over privacy on the web. The actions we take within our projects, however small, can help to protect people from those who would use their data to hurt them. That&#8217;s the most important thing any developer can ever do.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:30:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Contributing to Gutenberg: A New Contributor’s Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84718\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/contributing-to-gutenberg-a-new-contributors-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8005:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img />\n</div>\n\n<p>The following is a guest post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisVanPatten\">Chris Van Patten</a> who shares his experience learning and contributing to Gutenberg. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk of Gutenberg&#8217;s higher barrier to entry for new contributors.  Van Patten is the founder of <a href=\"https://tomodomo.co\">Tomodomo</a>, a digital agency for magazine publishers. <br /></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<p>Over the past few months, but especially over the last few weeks, there has been extensive conversation about the barriers to entry present in contributing to the upcoming Gutenberg editor for WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, everyone&#8217;s experiences are subjective and unique. I can&#8217;t pretend to understand what everyone has felt. But my experience has been different than what some folks have been articulating, and I wanted to share my own take.</p>\n\n<h1>The Early Days</h1>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used WordPress for close to half my life; almost 15 years now. I remember some of the earliest versions of WordPress: the classic theme, the advent of Kubrick, MP6, up through today.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img />\nEarly Days of the WordPress Backend\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Like many in the community, I&#8217;m entirely self-taught. I have no background in computer science, and have no formal instruction under my belt. I picked up code through trial-and-error, tweaking files and breaking my site as I wanted to make changes.</p>\n\n<p>Since those early days, WordPress was always my CMS of choice both for personal projects and for clients with my agency Tomodomo. But even though I had committed to the WordPress platform, my contributions back were limited.</p>\n\n<p>The rules, rituals, and etiquette around posting on Trac seemed arcane and illegible. To this day, I could not make an SVN patch if my life depended on it. And much of the core code, imbued with years of history and backwards compatibility, was hard for me to pick apart.</p>\n\n<p>So instead, I contributed in other ways: open sourcing simple custom plugins I was building, organizing WordCamps and meetups, and speaking at WordCamps around the globe. But it always bothered me that I couldn&#8217;t find a way to get those elusive &#8216;props&#8217;.</p>\n\n<p>(Okay, so I did actually get props on one release, but I am convinced it was a mistake; I had neither opened the ticket or provided a patch.)</p>\n\n<h1>Going… Going… Gutenberg</h1>\n\n<p>When I first learned about Gutenberg and started exploring, I was apprehensive. At first it seemed scary. My JavaScript abilities didn&#8217;t extend beyond jQuery. React was inscrutable and it seemed like I&#8217;d need a doctorate to understand some of the ideas behind it. I still don&#8217;t understand how Webpack works its magic. Does anyone, really?</p>\n\n<p>But the possibilities of the new block interface were too enticing to ignore, so I started diving in and figuring out how it worked. In those halcyon days (aka earlier this year), Gutenberg was still pretty rough around the edges, and there were a lot of opportunities for improvement. I started lurking on the GitHub repo, reading issues, examining the code, and generally trying to wrap my head around what the heck was going on.</p>\n\n<p>As I was playing around with Gutenberg for a client project, I started reporting issues: simple things, like user interface bugs. I started commenting on tickets, usually offering suggestions for a particular feature, trying to advocate from the perspective of independent developers.</p>\n\n<p>I even <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/6855\">filed my first pull request</a>! It was simple. I updated the README to include the day and time of the weekly #core-editor meeting (Wednesdays at 1pm UTC, if you&#8217;re wondering). It was an inauspicious beginning, but I was excited to get it merged.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, my knowledge grew. It was like my early days in web development, learning a CSS property here, and an HTML element there. I learned what a component was and how you could reuse them in different situations. I learned about JSX, and ES6, and some of the other crazy acronyms you encounter in Gutenland.</p>\n\n<p>As I was building more with Gutenberg, I was also finding new ways to <em>build Gutenberg itself</em>. I was able to understand more of the discussions, and offer my thoughts and suggestions. I started opening pull requests, largely dealing with design issues but also solving small bugs and quirks. I made a point of attending the weekly meeting I had previously added to the README, chiming in when I felt I had more perspective to share.</p>\n\n<p>Today I have 25 new issues and 27 pull requests under my belt, in addition to dozens of comments on existing tickets. I&#8217;m a &#8216;member&#8217; of the Gutenberg team on GitHub, and try to find time every day to triage new bugs or review pull requests. It took me most of the year to get to that point and it certainly wasn&#8217;t always easy. I still have so much to learn.</p>\n\n<p>When I hear about how difficult it is to contribute to Gutenberg, I can&#8217;t reconcile that with my own experience. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s a breeze: Gutenberg does things very differently than WordPress core, and there is undoubtedly a learning curve.</p>\n\n<h1>Advice for Contributing to Gutenberg</h1>\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t comfortable coding from day one, there are so many other ways to contribute. Read through issues and add your own ideas and suggestions. Try testing and replicating bug reports. Hunt through inline documentation for typos and grammar corrections. All of these are valuable, and always appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>As you absorb the Guten-way through osmosis, you&#8217;ll find that the code isn&#8217;t as hard as you think — it&#8217;s just different. The intelligent people who build Gutenberg have done a great job at hiding away the &#8216;computer-science&#8217; bits so the rest of us don&#8217;t have to worry about data binding and other complex ideas. I still cannot explain state management, data stores, or context APIs but I have managed to find small areas of the code to improve.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to deny anyone&#8217;s frustration or confusion with Gutenberg and its development. Documentation is still lacking in many places. Some of the APIs are unintuitive. The tooling isn&#8217;t the simplest to set up. These are real problems, and I don&#8217;t want to pretend they don&#8217;t exist; we can undoubtedly do more to make Gutenberg development easier.</p>\n\n<p>And of course I have privilege to check: I&#8217;m lucky to have the time to spend in the GitHub repo, experimenting with code, and participating in weekly meetings. I recognize that&#8217;s not a reality for many people.</p>\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find the time, the Classic Editor will continue to be an option, and there&#8217;s no shame in prolonging the upgrade. It may take time for the Gutenberg experience to be as intuitive as we would all like it to be, and waiting for that is totally reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>But if you open yourself to some new ideas about what WordPress can be, and can make the time, you may end up surprised at how easy it is to contribute. If you get stumped, pop into <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-editor/\">#core-editor</a> or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">forums</a>. Don&#8217;t be afraid to post a bug report or suggestion; we might consolidate it with another issue if it was previously reported, but the additional information is still valuable. Every experience matters.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m incredibly excited about the future of WordPress with Gutenberg and to finally be a real WordPress contributor. We have a long way to go, but that means there are still many exciting ways to make a difference. The project will only get stronger with more independent community voices chiming in.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join us!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 02:32:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WordCamp for Publishers Seeks Host City for 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84683\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-seeks-host-city-for-2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1634:\"<p>WordCamp For Publishers&#8217; distributed organizing team is looking for a new host city in 2019.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/wp-js-plugin-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress JavaScript Plugin Starter</a> is unique in that it is built as a tutorial, not just a boilerplate. The GitHub repo contains eight commits that have been structured to explain each step along the way. Benguella designed the repository to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I quickly setup a WordPress environment and how do I bake it into my plugin?</li>\n<li>How do I define a WordPress Plugin?</li>\n<li>How do I load a simple JavaScript script in WordPress?</li>\n<li>How do I bundle my JavaScript files?</li>\n<li>How do I use advanced JavaScript features like JSX?</li>\n<li>How do I build a production-ready version of my plugin?</li>\n<li>How does all this fit together?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Benguella predicts a shift in the WordPress development community, as JavaScript skills become essential for extending core&#8217;s rapidly evolving JS-based UI. Plugin architecture is changing to accommodate that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plugin developers are required to use JavaScript more in order to extend the editor,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Most blocks need to be developed using this technology. The modules Gutenberg provides (Components, data module, i18n, apiFetch…) will also encourage developers to extend other parts of WP-Admin in JavaScript. Instead of writing HTML/CSS screens from scratch and rendering them from the server, developers are able to bootstrap and prototype fully accessible new screens in WP-Admin by composing these components in a small number lines of code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Benguella&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/wp-js-plugin-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress JavaScript Plugin Starter</a> resource demystifies the plugin creation process with detailed explanations of each step throughout the readme file.

The first <a href=\"https://2019.nordic.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Nordic 2019</a> is set to be held in Helsinki, Finland the weekend of March 7-8 at the <a href=\"https://www.paasitorni.fi/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paasitorni Congress Center</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some folks from the Norwegian community came up with idea in 2016,&#8221; lead organizer Marco Martins said. &#8220;Then in a WordCamp Stockholm we got people together and we discussed the idea. But it was earlier this year in WordCamp Jyväskylä (Finland) that we decided to commit to it and organize it. After that I went to Oslo to discuss personally with people from the Nordic countries and we came to an agreement. We gathered a team from the different countries and here we are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The international organizing team is planning for approximately 600 attendees but the venue has the capacity for 800 people, if ticket demand is higher than expected. Paasitorni is an 111-year old complex brimming with historic significance. The Art Nouveau style building is also known as the Helsinki Workers&#8217; House, previously serving as leisure premises for the working class. It also provided the headquarters for the Red army during the 1918 Finnish Civil War. In the 1990&#8217;s it was remodeled to be a conference center and now includes a hotel and restaurants on premises.</p>\n<p>Finland has a stable and active WordPress community, which Martins said was one of the factors in the decision to host the first WordCamp Nordic in Helsinki. Regular meetups are held across the country in Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, Oulu, and Seinäjoki. The local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WPHelsinki/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Helsinki Meetup</a> group has more than 900 members with average attendance of 20-60 attendees each month.</p>\n<p>Helsinki has hosted two previous WordCamps, both averaging more than 220 attendees. Three other WordCamps were held in Turku, Tampere, and Jyväskylä, along with an unofficial <a href=\"https://wp-metsa.fi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Metsä</a> (&#8220;WP Forest&#8221;) in 2017, featuring cabins, lakes, outdoor tubs, sauna, and lightning talks by the fire. According to local organizers, Finnish camps have always sold out sponsor packages and tickets relatively fast.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic will host a Contributor Day on March 7, followed by the main event on March 8. Organizers expect attendees from Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and other countries, with likely the most attendees from Finland. All the sessions will be conducted in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While Nordic countries have very close ties both culturally and historically, one of the challenges we often face when thinking of attending a local WordCamp in the region is language,&#8221; co-organizer Niko Pettersen said. &#8220;Even though most Finns learn Swedish in school, the language often stays at a basic level and doesn’t extend to technical things such as WordPress. By having all of our talks in English, we’re hoping to level the playing field and hopefully attract more people from all around the world to come and listen to what these communities have to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers are still in the process of discussing what topics they would like to see, but Pettersen said many Nordic countries tend to focus heavily on education, the environment, and healthcare. &#8220;Also with the EU Accessibility Directive coming to full effect in the coming years, I have a feeling a11y will be one of the major topics we will want to cover,&#8221; Pettersen said.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic will also be hosting an informal Activity Day on March 9th where attendees will be welcome to join various activities, such as karaoke, cycling tours, trips to islands, and other other events coordinated by the community and sponsors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is something that Oslo has been doing informally the day after the camp and the feedback has been great so we thought it would be a good idea to have the activity day for people to do something together and experience something Finnish in more informal way,&#8221; Martins said. &#8220;We are planning the activities, but sauna for sure, because Finland.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One unique aspect of Finnish culture is the national obsession with saunas, and WordCamp Nordic organizers are ready to introduce attendees to Finland&#8217;s favorite pastime.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Traditionally saunas have been a place to cleanse the body and mind, but more recently travelers have discovered it is also a great place to meet locals, share experiences and get tips on where to go next,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;If you’ve never been to one, I warmly suggest you extend your stay over the weekend as we’re planning on taking groups to some of the new public saunas in Helsinki during the Activity Day the day after the event.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Nordic Organizers Aim to Revitalize Local Communities by Fostering New Meetup Groups</h3>\n<p>Finland is the birth place of many open source projects, including SSH, MySQL, Linux, and IRC. WordCamp Nordic organizers hope to inspire that same spirit of collaboration among neighboring WordPress communities by hosting the regional camp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the goals we listed in our initial proposal was to focus on revitalizing the local communities in the region and help to form new meetup groups by getting the organizers and interested parties together during Contributor Day,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;We saw our meetup scene grow in Finland from one to six in the space of a few years largely thanks events like these and good mentoring from the community at large.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers plan to keep the camp running in future years but have not yet settled on the selection process for future host cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as WordCamp Europe is organized during the summer, I have a feeling future events will be leaning towards spring/autumn or winter,&#8221; Pettersen said. &#8220;The selection process is still up for debate, but I imagine whoever feels like this is their calling will have the full support of the Nordic community to carry on where we left off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Nordic joins a small list of regional WordCamps that have become can&#8217;t-miss, enriching events for many in the WordPress community. Tickets will go on sale at the end of October.

The company has also launched <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/developer-preview/\">Tiny Drive</a>, a preview of <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/developer-preview/\">TinyMCE 5</a>, and the <a href=\"https://go.tiny.cloud/partners/\">Tiny App Directory</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>TinyMCE&#8217;s Relationship With Gutenberg</h2>\n\n<p>Gutenberg is built on top of TinyMCE and this has led to few misconceptions about the project. To alleviate these misconceptions, Tiny published a <a href=\"https://go.tiny.cloud/blog/gutenberg-tinymce-faq/\">Gutenberg and TinyMCE FAQ</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>TinyMCE is used by the Classic Editor but as the FAQ explains, they are not one in the same and never have been. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Classic Editor is <em>less</em> than TinyMCE in that it exposes just 6 of the 54 of the <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/\">official plugins</a> and a fraction of the UI. A popular WordPress plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/\">TinyMCE Advanced</a> created by Andrew Ozz exposes more of TinyMCE’s UI, core features, and plugins.</p><p>The Classic Editor is also <em>more</em> than TinyMCE in that there is significant custom code in WordPress. This includes WordPress-specific UI components and backend code for embedding, links, media, and more. Some of the filtering code is specific to WordPress.</p><cite>Andrew Roberts</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Gutenberg uses TinyMCE to provide rich text editing and provides a Classic editor block that contains some UI elements from TinyMCE, but that&#8217;s about it. </p>\n\n<p>Both projects have a close relationship but as Roberts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/rich-text-editing-platform-tiny-raises-4m-launches-file-management-service/\">noted on TechCrunch</a>, the two are not mutually dependent on each other.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Tiny’s core business comes from a mix of software vendors, large enterprises, and agencies building custom solutions for clients that has little to do with the WordPress ecosystem,” Roberts told TechCrunch. “It is a popular and commercially viable project in its own right.</p>\n\n<p>While TinyMCE 5 features a brand new UI, earlier versions such as 4.7 were inspired by beta versions of Gutenberg. Tiny is not yet committed to making block based editing the default but is keeping a close eye on how Gutenberg rolls out. </p>\n\n<p>TinyMCE and WordPress are open source projects that will continue to benefit each other as it makes sense. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The TinyMCE and WordPress projects have had a symbiotic relationship over the years. We hope that this goodwill and sense of community continues for many years to come,&#8221; Roberts said.<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 03:57:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 333 – Interview With Mike ‘Shredder’ Schroder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=84675&preview=true&preview_id=84675\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-333-interview-with-mike-shredder-schroder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1895:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GetSource\">Mike Schroder</a>. Schroder co-led the release of WordPress 3.9 and in 2016, he led the release of WordPress 4.5.</p>\n<p>In the interview, we learn his WordPress origin story, his thoughts on Gutenberg and whether or not he sees it as the future of WordPress, the WordPress media component, and near the end of the show, he explains how he received the nickname Shredder.</p>\n<h2>Useful Links Mentioned:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/\">A Detailed List of Meetings of the Various WordPress Core Teams</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/new-contributors/\">New Contributors Bi-Monthly Meeting</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/\">WordPress Core Contributor Handbook</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/12/mike-schroder-tammie-lister-media-matters/\">Mike Schroder and Tammie Lister&#8217;s Presentation from WCUS 2017 &#8211; Media Matters</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-hires-mike-schroder-to-contribute-to-wordpress-core-full-time\">GoDaddy Hires Mike Schroder to Contribute to WordPress Core Full-Time</a></p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, October 17th 3:00 P.M.

During today&#8217;s core developer chat, Matias Ventura, the project&#8217;s technical lead, said he plans to post a full changelog and a video tomorrow. In the meantime, a call for testing 4.0 RC 1 has been posted to the make.wordpress.org/test blog with a list of 15 specific testing items highlighted for attention.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 4.0 introduces several new features, (including but not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add ability to change overlay color in Cover Image</li>\n<li>New Font Size Picker with clear labels and size comparison</li>\n<li>New RichText data structure to allow better manipulation of inline content</li>\n<li>Add Pullquote style variation and color palette support</li>\n<li>Add support for post locking when multiple authors interact with the editor</li>\n<li>Add support for shortcode embeds that enqueue scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A running list of the enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes is available on GitHub in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a>. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/deprecated/#4-0-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecations for 4.0.0</a> are outlined in the Gutenberg handbook.</p>\n<p>Grzegorz Ziółkowski has published Gutenberg&#8217;s npm packages this evening, so the team can move forward on core integration with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Accessibility has been one of the recent concerns with the project, as there are many outstanding <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccessibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> with this tag. One of the most prolific contributors to testing, Andrea Fercia, has stated that the editor in its current state is &#8220;barely usable&#8221; for those with accessibility needs. Joe Dolson, another WordPress accessibility contributor, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2018/10/wordpress-accessibility-and-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reaction post</a> that concurs with Fercia&#8217;s assessment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The leadership within the Gutenberg project has not taken seriously the scope of accessibility problems in Gutenberg,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;I do not want to diminish the dedication to accessibility issues at some levels. The dedication to producing accessible content is still very high. But I’m not seeing dedication to developing an accessible authoring tool. It’s as if there’s no awareness of the needs of authors with disabilities; only consumers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If WordPress 5.0 is released on schedule, Dolson said he believes it is &#8220;almost a guarantee that the first release of Gutenberg in WordPress will not be accessible,&#8221; as there are too many major accessibility issues left to resolve.</p>\n<p>Matthew MacPherson, the new accessibility lead for WordPress 5.0, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318#issue-366539284\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he is willing to bet that Gutenberg is more accessible than the Classic Editor and that the perception of its inaccessibility is based on older evaluations of earlier releases:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think there&#8217;s a notion of Gutenberg being inaccessible because of older accessibility audits that identified a lot of issues in the very early versions. Things have changed a lot since the early days, and when the plugin was labeled &#8220;1.0&#8221; it was hardly a ready-to-ship product. I worry that many of those sentiments haven&#8217;t been re-examined and updated, so there is a prevailing idea that Gutenberg is not accessible or is entirely less accessible than the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d venture is that Gutenberg is selectively less accessible, but overall more accessible feature-for-feature. Something like a date picker or a certain interaction being inaccessible does not make the entire editor inaccessible. Feature-for-feature, compared to a classic editor with similar capabilities (eg a bunch of plugins installed), I&#8217;d bet* Gutenberg is more accessible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite his suggestion that Gutenberg&#8217;s current accessibility issues are likely not as critical as contributors have claimed, MacPherson is willing to coordinate an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">independent accessibility audit</a> to get an outside opinion. Selection of the company to perform the audit is currently in process.</p>\n<p>After the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-lead-resigns-cites-political-complications-related-to-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resignation of team rep Rian Rietveld</a>, accessibility contributors are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2018/10/09/suggested-agenda-for-meeting-on-october-15th/#comment-72719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">meeting next Monday</a> to get reorganized and discuss the leadership and decision processes of the team.</p>\n<p>Many have speculated outside of official channels on whether the recent shakeup in the leadership of the accessibility team is a referendum on the aggressive timeline for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core or simply the natural turnover in open source projects when friction cannot be resolved. A truly independent accessibility audit, with results that are shared transparently to the WordPress community, will reveal whether current perceptions of Gutenberg&#8217;s lack of accessibility are accurate.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Needs%20Accessibility%20Feedback\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Needs Accessibility Feedback</a>&#8221; label is available for use on the Gutenberg GitHub repository to facilitate communication between developers and accessibility contributors.

The new module, built on the same infrastructure as the Photon CDN, speeds up sites by cloud-hosting widely-used Jetpack and core WordPress scripts, styles, and assets. It takes a load off of users&#8217; servers and increases the allowed maximum concurrent connections through Photon. Once it is ready for use in production, the Asset CDN will be a new opt-in feature that can help speed up Jetpack&#8217;s 5+ million active installations.</p>\n<p>Version 6.6 also adds the necessary infrastructure for new Gutenberg blocks. The activity on the plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository indicates the team is <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/projects/14\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">working on a number of blocks for existing features</a>, including things like recipes, shortcodes, Jetpack subscription form, Simple Payments, Publicize, the contact form, tweet shortcode, VR shortcode, Giphy, and more.

Their contributions have primarily been limited to testing and reporting issues. Rietveld said team members experienced frustration when they tested and improved functionality but saw it changed at a later stage, breaking accessibility requirements again. She also cites a lack of commitment to keyboard testing new features before implementation.</p>\n<p>Rietveld said she used her network to try to get more companies and developers with React skills involved in Gutenberg accessibility contribution. In March, tests they ran on the plugin revealed a staggering number of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccessibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg accessibility issues</a> that remain unresolved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The results indicated so many accessibility issues that most testers refused to look at Gutenberg again,&#8221; Rietveld said. She included a statement from fellow contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/afercia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Fercia</a>, who has been highly active in testing Gutenberg functionality and reporting issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While the Gutenberg team has worked hard to implement some fundamental accessibility features (e.g. focus management, navigate landmark regions), the overall user experience is terribly complicated for users with accessibility needs at the point the new editor is barely usable for them. </p>\n<p>The main reason for this lack of overall accessibility is in the overall Gutenberg design, where accessibility hasn’t been incorporated in the design process. </p>\n<p>Feedback from accessibility users has been constantly evaluated and Gutenberg is actually a regression in terms of accessibility level, compared to the previous editor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Gutenberg project now has a dedicated developer from Automattic, <a href=\"http://codinginairports.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew MacPherson</a>, who is working on accessibility issues and Rietveld said she hopes the core accessibility team will continue to offer him all the support he needs.</p>\n<p>Rietveld&#8217;s resignation is a major loss to the WordPress project. For years her leadership and contributions have demonstrated the project&#8217;s commitment to serving those with a disability.</p>\n<p>In 2016, she was instrumental in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress adopting accessibility coding standards for all new and updated code</a>. Rietveld was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributor-rian-rietveld-wins-heroes-of-accessibility-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recognized by Knowbility.org</a> as &#8220;a knowledgeable, dedicated, and effective advocate for accessibility in the global WordPress community,&#8221; whose achievements had a major impact on the application used by more than 25% of the world at that time. She took first place in the Individual Achievement category of the Heroes of Accessibility Awards.</p>\n<p>News of Rietveld&#8217;s resignation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RianRietveld/status/1049615192626253825\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roused an outpouring of sadness and gratitude on Twitter</a>. The WordPress community thanked her for her work and that of other accessibility contributors, whose efforts often go unappreciated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m not leaving WordPress nor accessibility, and in fact maybe now I can actually work on accessibility again,&#8221; Rietveld said. &#8220;I will keep giving talks and workshops. I also want to do research and work on tickets. But in my own pace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will join the a11y table if asked on contributor days, but maybe I’ll just go to a museum instead.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 16:27:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Alexis Lloyd and Riad Benguella Will Lead Phase Two of Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/alexis-lloyd-and-riad-benguella-will-lead-phase-two-of-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3856:\"<p>As activity ramps up to try to get WordPress 5.0 released in November, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/\">has announced</a> who will lead phase two of the Gutenberg project. Phase two focuses on Customization and entire site layouts. </p>\n\n<p>Alexis Lloyd, Head of Design Innovation at Automattic, will handle the design and product side. Riad Benguella, a JavaScript Engineer at Automattic, will handle the technical side of the project. </p>\n\n<p>One of the goals of phase two is to replace widgets with blocks and menus with a navigation block. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/#comment-34057\">Lloyd</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/05/gutenberg-phase-2-leads/#comment-34063\">Benguella</a> commented on the post, introducing themselves to the community. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Hi all! I’m thrilled to be working on phase 2 of Gutenberg,&#8221; Lloyd said. &#8220;I think there’s a huge opportunity to take the ease of use that has been brought to page/post editing in phase 1 and extend that to the full site experience. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m coming from many years leading design and product teams in news organizations (including designing and building custom CMSes), and am looking forward to bringing my experience to WordPress, as well as learning from the deep expertise in the community!&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Hi all! I’m so excited to be working with you all alongside <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexislloyd/\">@alexislloyd</a> to build upon the amazing technology that is Gutenberg in order to bring the content creation experience in WordPress to a whole new level,&#8221; Benguella said.<br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;For those who don’t know me yet, I’m a JavaScript engineer at Automattic. I’ve been fortunate to have contributed to the Gutenberg project since its beginning, including a lot of work on Gutenberg APIs, JavaScript in Core, and Accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I look forward to bringing my humble expertise to achieve the second phase of this project, as we look into things like widgets, menus, templates, and site-building in general.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>Theseus&#8217;s Paradox  Makes More Sense Now</h2>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-331-status-update-on-gutenberg-with-gary-pendergast\">episode 331 of WordPress Weekly</a>, one of the items we discussed with Gary Pendergast is the future of Gutenberg beyond the editor. At its core, Gutenberg is supposed to unify a number of areas of WordPress. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Blocks are the unifying evolution of what is now covered, in different ways, by shortcodes, embeds, widgets, post formats, custom post types, theme options, meta-boxes, and other formatting elements. They embrace the breadth of functionality WordPress is capable of, with the clarity of a consistent user experience.</p><cite>From the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg Plugin Page</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>I hypothesized that since Gutenberg is an interface to manage blocks and that menus as well as widgets will become blocks, the menus and widget management pages in the WordPress backend can be replaced or removed in favor of Gutenberg. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, the Menu and Widget management boards on <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">the Ship of Theseus </a>would be replaced without sinking or disrupting the entire boat. </p>\n\n<p>With Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement regarding phase two, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\">Ship Of Theseus or Theseus’s paradox</a> begins to make more sense. Gutenberg becomes the foundation for bringing many areas of the WordPress project up to par without starting from scratch.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 01:52:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Miami WordPresser Todrick Moore Passes Away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/miami-wordpresser-todrick-moore-passes-away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:928:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Todrick Moore Courtesy of <a href=\"http://davidbisset.com/todrick-moore/\">David Bisset</a></div>\n\n<p>Fellow WordPresser Todrick Moore, a member of the Miami WordPress community and volunteer organizer of WordCamp Miami 2015 and 2016  passed away last week of Leukemia.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Todrick Moore was one of the kindest and strongest members of the South Florida WordPress community, and I still to this day remember meeting him first at his local meetup,&#8221; David Bisset said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Like many people who come to meetups he was eager to learn, but also as I would quickly come to realize, he would be eager to help others as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about Todrick and how to help out his wife with their <a href=\"https://www.madeinthemia.com/\">WordPress business site</a>, please <a href=\"http://davidbisset.com/todrick-moore/\">read this post</a> by David Bisset.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:24:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: How the Student-Owned Pelham Examiner Uses WordPress to Empower Young Journalists\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-student-owned-pelham-examiner-uses-wordpress-to-empower-young-journalists\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4229:\"<p>When the <a href=\"https://newsofpelham.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">News of Pelham</a> became another casualty of the blighted newspaper industry, student journalist contributors lost a platform for their voices to be heard. Their advisor, Rich Zahradnik, called a meeting to address the paper&#8217;s closure. More than a dozen middle and high school kids showed up and decided to start their own paper: <a href=\"https://www.pelhamexaminer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Pelham Examiner</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.richzahradnik.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zahradnik</a> is a former journalist who has been volunteering for years in the local elementary schools, teaching kids how to write news stories. Before the News of Pelham shut down he was acting as a liaison to recruit student contributors. He registered the Examiner as a corporation and the paper is also part of the New York Press Association.</p>\n<p>The Pelham Examiner is an online-only publication that covers everything from local politics and crime to sports and entertainment. It is running on WordPress, using plugins like All-in-One Event Calendar and WP Polls to enhance students&#8217; stories. The site uses the FLEX WordPress Theme by <a href=\"https://snosites.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SNO</a>, an organization that sells publishing solutions for scholastic news programs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screely-1539030523820.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress provided a cost-effective way to launch a student-run newspaper and students also found it to be intuitive for publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose to use WordPress mainly because of the ease with which we could use it and create a website look that worked for our goal,&#8221; Executive Editor Ben Glickman said. Zahradnik had used the platform with prior publications he had worked on with students at Colonial Elementary School.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Several of the students who had worked on The Colonial Times loosely remembered some aspects of WordPress, but most of us had to learn from the beginning,&#8221; Glickman said. &#8220;I started with the basics (creating new articles, saving drafts, etc.) and worked my way up to the more complex stuff.&#8221; Most students contributing to the Pelham Examiner didn&#8217;t require much training to get up to speed with publishing articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I thought that much of WordPress was rather intuitive, so learning was not too hard,&#8221; Glickman said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had any problems with WordPress so far. I&#8217;ve been especially impressed with how easy it is to integrate all kinds of story elements into a given story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Poynter published a <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/when-paper-they-were-writing-folded-kids-started-their-own\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> last week about the enthusiastic and highly motivated group of young journalists behind the <a href=\"https://www.pelhamexaminer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pelham Examiner</a>. For now the publication is self-sustaining with volunteer contributions, but Zahradnik told Poynter that he is open to ads or investors in the future.</p>\n<p>Sustaining the news as a business is another skill the students will need to learn as the publishing industry is increasingly demanding more creative revenue models from journalists who want to work independently. Zahradnik told Poynter that the Pelham Examiner&#8217;s student-owned online paper could be a model for other places that are no longer able to support traditional local newspapers.</p>\n<p>The News of Pelham was a bi-weekly, print-only publication before it closed its doors. With a WordPress-powered website, students can get the news out faster, publishing every day with virtually no overhead costs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the model for the Examiner is absolutely reproducible,&#8221; Glickman said. &#8220;For the relatively small price of a startup fee and annual hosting and support fees, you can essentially have the same type of town or city coverage with a conventional town newspaper.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 20:52:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Schedule Published, WooCommerce Team to Deliver Keynote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84428\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-schedule-published-woocommerce-team-to-deliver-keynote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1835:\"<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a>, the virtual WooCommerce conference, is now less than two weeks away.

Day 2 is geared towards developers and will focus on more technical topics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/toddwilkens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Wilkens</a>, Head of WooCommerce, will be giving the keynote along with Aviva Pinchas and Kelly Hoffman. The session is titled &#8220;The Past, Present, and Future of WooCommerce&#8221; and it will be followed up with a Q&amp;A time.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://panel.socialpilot.co/site/video/eNiqGdpe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a>, Wilkens told Patrick Rauland that they have been working to rethink the merchant experience of the platform, as it has traditionally offered more of a builder style experience. This is one topic they plan to discuss in the keynote, in addition to where they see WooCommerce going as a platform, some recent successes, and how WooCommerce fits into other trends with WordPress and e-commerce in general.</p>\n<p>Attendees can watch all sessions for free as long as they attend at least one presentation during the live event. Registration is open on the <a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a> website.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 05:58:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: If Deadlines Are Not Arbitrary, Why Not Release WordPress 5.0 in the Beginning of January?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/if-deadlines-are-not-arbitrary-why-not-release-wordpress-5-0-in-the-beginning-of-january\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3933:\"<p>The WordPress 5.0 release schedule <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-0-slated-for-november-19-2018\">has been published</a> and not everyone is excited about the expected November 19th release.

What a terrible decision to push this during a holiday week&#8230;</p>&mdash; Jennifer Bourn (@jenniferbourn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn/status/1047845139912122368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2018</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>Historically, WordPress has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\">shipped major versions</a> in early to mid December rather than November. Holidays were considered because of the sharp drop-off in volunteer contribution activity. These versions were also part of a rigid and predictable four month schedule to get <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">three major releases out per year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, WordPress 5.0 is no ordinary major release. It will contain Gutenberg and completely revamp the content creation and editing experience. Not to mention, we won&#8217;t know the full extent of plugin and theme compatibility until it&#8217;s installed on millions of sites. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the proposed release date and <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> taking place on December 7th, it&#8217;s not out of the question to theorize the release occurring before and because of WCUS. It should be noted though that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\">roadmap Matt Mullenweg outlined at WordCamp EU</a> earlier this year originally targeted a late August release.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be a bummer if WordPress 5.0 was not released before WordCamp US. However, it would be irresponsible as a project leader to force a release for public relations reasons.</p>\n\n<p>As Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-5-0-release-plan-estimates-release-candidate-to-ship-in-november#comment-262936\">commented</a> in a recently published article, he won&#8217;t release WordPress 5.0 until it&#8217;s ready. I don&#8217;t think releasing it to have a big moment on stage would qualify as being ready.</p>\n\n<p>I think there should be consideration in pushing the release date to the beginning of next year. What better way to ring in the new year with a completely new editor in WordPress. It bypasses the holidays concern and allows people to apply all of their focus on making sure 5.0 is rolled out smoothly to sites they manage.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been in development for more than a year and a half. Since the WordPress release strategy was thrown out the window last year and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/\">deadlines are not arbitrary</a>, what&#8217;s a few more weeks of development and testing before pushing WordPress 5.0 to the public?<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 03:09:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme and Plugin Shops are Pioneering the First Layout Blocks for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shops-are-pioneering-the-first-layout-blocks-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5995:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/layout.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/EWENELMHYR\">Jeffrey Betts</a>\n<p>Many WordPress theme shops started out with themes as their only products but over the years have moved into selling plugins that enhance their core products. This came about partially because theming standards evolved to encourage developers to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-theme-developers-are-moving-functionality-into-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">put non-presentational functionality into plugins</a>. For many, the revenue from plugins quickly eclipsed that of their theme products. In the past, theme shops have often partnered with page builder plugins to enhance their users&#8217; capabilities in customizing the themes. This may soon change, as the advent of Gutenberg is bringing new product opportunities to theme and plugin shops shops.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the new editor focuses on blocks and the post editing experience. After Gutenberg is in core, the project will move on to the second phase &#8211; full site customization. This will venture into page builder type functionality. Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1037843717070057472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">predicts this phase will happen much faster than phase 1</a>, since all of the infrastructure is already in place. The plugin already has a columns block in beta.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is scheduled to debut in WordPress 5.0 in November, but site customization functionality won&#8217;t arrive until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, plugin developers have been experimenting with various implementations of &#8220;section&#8221; and &#8220;container&#8221; blocks while the Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explores a core container block</a> for phase 2.</p>\n<p>Marie Comet&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/MarieComet/WP-container-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Container Block</a> is a fork of the core columns block that offers columns structure, spacing, and backgrounds (with both image and color controls). Felix Arntz recently published a tutorial on how he built a <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/blog/building-a-reusable-gutenberg-section-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reusable Gutenberg section block</a>. Marc Lacroix created his own <a href=\"https://github.com/marcusig/gutenberg-section-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">container block</a>, out of necessity, with capabilities for spacing and background customization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-10.26.43-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Section/container blocks are a precursor to using Gutenberg for building more complex layouts. Some of these explorations may inform the Gutenberg team&#8217;s implementation of a core container block in the future.</p>\n<p>A few more full-featured layout blocks are starting to pop up on WordPress.org. Kadence Themes, a theme and plugin shop based in Missoula, Montana, released its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kadence Blocks &#8211; Gutenberg Page Builder Toolkit</a> at the end of August. The plugin brings the editor closer to delivering the features users expect from popular page builders, such as better control of columns for different screen sizes and a <a href=\"https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/row-layout-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">row/layout block</a> with controls for padding, backgrounds, alignment, and overlays with gradients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/\" title=\"View on Instagram\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://instagr.am/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/media/?size=l\" alt=\"Instagram Photo\" /></a></p>\n<p>A live &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; style <a href=\"http://demo.kadencethemes.com/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo of Kadence Blocks</a> is available where you can see the plugin&#8217;s options for manipulating page layout.</p>\n<p>Pootlepress, a WordPress plugin and theme shop, has added a new Layouts block to its free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caxton plugin</a>. The company is one of the earlier Gutenberg adopters in the WooCommerce space with its recent release of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pootlepress-previews-upcoming-storefront-blocks-plugin-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront Blocks</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Caxton bills itself as a &#8220;page layout plugin&#8221; for Gutenberg. Its layout block allows users to select from a number of preset layouts and then add blocks within those layouts. It supports nesting rows and row backgrounds. A Frontenberg <a href=\"http://demo.caxton.pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo site</a> gives users the chance to play around with the page builder functionality before installing the plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\n<p>Until Gutenberg adds core support for more layout capabilities, WordPress may see an influx of these layout blocks that introduce basic page builder functionality. Some of these plugins may need to be refactored once there is more direction for these features in core, but they offer a glimpse of what Gutenberg will bring to site customization. Combined with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-9-introduces-reusable-exportable-templates-for-multiple-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.9&#8217;s reusable, exportable templates for multiple blocks</a>, page layouts will become more portable than ever. In 2019, we may see new sites popping up that enable users and developers to share the layout designs they have created.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 15:24:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 332 – The WordPress 5.0 Release Cycle Begins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=84436&preview=true&preview_id=84436\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-332-the-wordpress-5-0-release-cycle-begins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2241:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss the headlines making the rounds in the WordPress community.

The official release is targeted for November 19, 2018 with beta 1 expected October 19 and RC 1 released October 30.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting Gutenberg merged into core, the scope for 5.0 includes a few new items that Gary Pendergast outlined in his post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updating the default themes to work well with the block editor, and creating the new Twenty Nineteen theme.</li>\n<li>Creating an upgrade experience to remove the Gutenberg plugin and offer the Classic Editor plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>November 19 is the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when many are traveling or spending time with friends and family. As this is scheduled during a busy time of year and may have unexpected delays, the release leads have come up with a backup plan that includes a secondary schedule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know there is a chance that 5.0 will need additional time, so these dates can slip by up to 8 days if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. His post proposes an additional timeline that would have 5.0 land in January:</p>\n<p>Secondary RC 1: January 8, 2019</p>\n<p>Secondary Release: January 22, 2019</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current release date is November 19, but it can be pushed as late as November 27 if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;To avoid the numerous holidays from the end of November through to January, we&#8217;ll move the release to January if more time is needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the backup timeline should allay concerns about December holidays, if the release is at all delayed, it will run up against the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Should we need to switch to the secondary dates, this will be communicated as soon as we’re aware,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;It’s also important to note that we have some updates for PHP 7.3 compatibility that must be released in 2018 regardless, and we would have a short 4.9.9 release cycle for them if needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors had the opportunity to ask questions of the release leads during today&#8217;s 5.0 kickoff meeting. There was some uncertainty in yesterday&#8217;s announcements about whether 5.0 will ship a new default theme. Matt Mullenweg confirmed that they are aiming to get Twenty Nineteen into 5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest variable though, so if it takes longer we won&#8217;t delay the release for it,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Twenty Nineteen development will happen on GitHub and contributors can join the discussion in the #core-themes Slack channel where regular meetings will happen.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella posted a technical overview of the integration process for merging the new editor into core. He also laid out a plan for how Gutenberg development will continue in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After WordPress 5.0 is released, the Gutenberg plugin will continue to exist,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Its purpose will be changed to the development and the maintenance of the WordPress npm packages, including the editor itself, and will also serve to develop the second phase (site customization) of the Gutenberg project. Plugin updates will continue to be released during the 5.0 cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP part of the plugin won’t be needed anymore, as the plugin will just register new versions of the scripts of the packages to replace the ones already registered by Core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg confirmed during the dev chat that the team plans to add a link to the Classic Editor plugin in the admin when 5.0 ships. Overall, contributors in attendance seemed excited about the prospect of finally having the new editor in core, despite the ambitious timeline proposed for release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big benefit even beyond the user improvements is that plugin and theme developers will be able to truly use it as a base in a way that they can&#8217;t right now as a plugin,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If previous adoption curves hold true, we&#8217;d be on 10m sites (20x current adoption) by new year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg development has been moving quickly and after it is shipped to millions of WordPress users there are bound to be more issues discovered. Mullenweg said quick point releases may be an option for maintaining the flexibility to introduce fixes and improvements in a timely way for users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since 5.0 will be very tight (just Gutenberg, PHP 7.3, and possibly theme) I am open to having 5.0.x releases that are like the 4.9.x releases that bring in some larger updates or improvements we push off, like servehappy stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura has outlined the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tasks remaining on the editor</a>. An updated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">schedule for the 5.0 release cycle</a> is now available for the public to follow. Gary Pendergast, who is shepherding the merge, said he expects WordPress 5.1 will be available around March 2019.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 23:23:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Gary: WordPress 5.0 Needs You!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=2160\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://pento.net/2018/10/04/wordpress-5-0-needs-you/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6289:\"<p>Yesterday, we started the WordPress 5.0 release cycle with an announcement post.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\" content_cards_card content_cards_domain_make-wordpress-org\">\n			<div class=\"content_cards_image\">\n				<a class=\"content_cards_image_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n					<img src=\"https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screen-shot-2018-10-02-at-8.39.21-pm-1.png\" alt=\"A Plan for 5.0\" />				</a>\n		</div>\n	\n	<div class=\"content_cards_title\">\n		<a class=\"content_cards_title_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n			A Plan for 5.0		</a>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"content_cards_description\">\n		<a class=\"content_cards_description_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n			<p>Usually during major releases of WordPress, the dedicated release lead chooses a few folks to help them through the time-consuming work of managing an excellent release cycle.

I think I speak for everyone on the leadership team when I say that we all feel the same on this. We want everyone to be able to participate, which will require some cooperation from everyone in the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n<p>The release post was published as soon as it was written, we wanted to get it out quickly, so everyone could be aware of what&#8217;s going on. Publishing quickly does mean that we&#8217;re still writing the more detailed posts about scope, and timeline, and processes. Instead of publishing a completed plan all at once, we intentionally want to include everyone from the start, and evolve plans as we get feedback.</p>\n\n<p>With no other context, the WordPress 5.0 timeline of &#8220;release candidate in about a month&#8221; would be very short, which is why we&#8217;ve waited until Gutenberg had proved itself before setting a timeline. As we mentioned in the post, WordPress 5.0 will be &#8220;WordPress 4.9.8 + Gutenberg&#8221;. The Gutenberg plugin is <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\">running on nearly 500k sites</a>, and WordPress 4.9.8 is running on millions of sites. For comparison, it&#8217;s considered a well tested major version if we see 20k installs before the final release date. Gutenberg is a bigger change than we&#8217;ve done in the past, so should be held to a higher standard, and I think we can agree that 500k sites is a pretty good test base: it arguably meets, or even exceeds that standard.</p>\n\n<p>We can have a release candidate ready in a month.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg\">Try Gutenberg</a></div>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg core team are currently focussed on finishing off the last few features. The Gutenberg plugin has evolved exceedingly quickly thanks to their work, it&#8217;s moved so much faster than anything we&#8217;ve done in WordPress previously. As we transition to bug fixing, you should expect to see the same rapid improvement.</p>\n\n<p>The block editor&#8217;s backwards compatibility with the classic editor is important, of course, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> is a part of that: if you have a site that doesn&#8217;t yet work with the block editor, please go ahead and install the plugin. I&#8217;d be happy to see the Classic Editor plugin getting 10 million or more installs, if people need it. That would both show a clear need for the classic interface to be maintained for a long time, and because it&#8217;s the official WordPress plugin for doing it, we can ensure that it&#8217;s maintained for as long as it&#8217;s needed. This isn&#8217;t a new scenario to the WordPress core team, we&#8217;ve been backporting security fixes to WordPress 3.7 for years. We&#8217;re never going to leave site owners out in the cold there, and exactly the same attitude applies to the Classic Editor plugin.</p>\n\n<p>The broader Gutenberg project is a <em>massive</em> change, and WordPress is a big ship to turn.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to take years to make this transition, and it&#8217;s okay if WordPress 5.0 isn&#8217;t everything for everyone. There&#8217;ll be a WordPress 5.1, and 5.2, and 5.3, and so on, the block editor will continue to evolve to work for more and more people.</p>\n\n<p>My role in WordPress 5.0 is to &#8220;generally shepherd the merge&#8221;. I&#8217;ve built or guided some of the most complex changes we&#8217;ve made in Core in recent years, and they&#8217;ve all been successful. I don&#8217;t intend to change that record, WordPress 5.0 will only be released when I&#8217;m as confident in it as I was for all of those previous projects.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I&#8217;m asking everyone in the WordPress community for a little bit of trust, that we&#8217;re all working with the best interests of WordPress at heart. I&#8217;m also asking for a little bit of patience, we&#8217;re only human, we can only type so fast, and we do need to sleep every now and then. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 isn&#8217;t the finish line, it&#8217;s the starter pistol.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">This is a marathon, not a sprint</a>, and the goal is to set WordPress up for the next 15 years of evolution. This can only happen one step at a time though, and the best way to get there will be by working together. We can have disagreements, we can have different priorities, and we can still come together to create the future of WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 22:14:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Hires Mike Schroder to Contribute to WordPress Core Full-Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84411\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-hires-mike-schroder-to-contribute-to-wordpress-core-full-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:986:\"<p><a href=\"https://getsource.net/\">Mike Schroder</a> known at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getsource?lang=en\">GetSource</a> on Twitter and Mike on WordPress&#8217; Slack instance <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/garage/mike-schroder-wordpress-core-contributor/\">is joining Aaron Campbell at GoDaddy</a> to contribute to WordPress full-time. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2011, Schroder has contributed to nearly every version of WordPress.

In some ways 5.0 is already de facto out in the wild, with some forward-looking hosts already installing and activating Gutenberg for new installs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg is leading the release but has designated 11 other leads to head up various focuses, including triage, design, JavaScript packages, REST API, merge process and several other important aspects of the release.</p>\n<p>WordPress users can also expect a new default Twenty Nineteen theme to ship with 5.0. Designer <a href=\"https://www.allancole.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Allan Cole</a> will be leading that project, which involves adapting an existing Gutenberg theme for use as WordPress&#8217; next default theme.</p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s developer chat left many attendees wondering about the status of WordPress 4.9.9.

The timeline for this major release falls during a busy time of year for many who will be responsible for preparing their products and client sites.

I wear a lot of hats but my favorite one is as a WordPress developer. And I am here to tell you about my journey. It was not easy. There were no shortcuts. I had to crawl my way up every single step of the way. And I still have to, it did not become easier – not by a long shot. But I’ve accepted that in order to succeed I have to take the long way and that is basically two words long – <strong>WORK HARD</strong>.</p>\n<p>When I was young, I wanted to be and do a lot of things. I wanted to be an astronaut, a lawyer, a geophysicist. I wanted a pet unicorn or a tiger or a lion or a snake. I wanted to be the first woman to roam the solar system, I wanted to be a world-renowned author. I never became nor did any of those but I did get a pet snake named Yudi and I have a lot of “pet” unicorns.</p>\n<p>I studied engineering because it was the “IT” course during my time. Did I like it? Let’s just say that I had a lot of fun, a lot of heartaches, a lot of sleepless nights and leave it at that. But if you really want to know &#8211; what I really, really want to be right now is to be a TimeLord STAT, but I digress. I think, the main reason I took that course was because I didn’t want to be with a lot of girls. I didn’t want to compete and I was not really into all that girly-girly stuff. It all changed, by the way. I graduated and took the board – I did not pass. Much to the horror of my engineer dad. I never really wanted to be an engineer so I did not bother taking the board again, instead, I worked in a call center. My first work was as a tech support for Dell computers. I got to tinker with laptops and help seniors fix theirs thousands of miles away and I even got to experience them happily shouting telling me that I do not know what I am doing. Fun times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I did that for a year and I decided that that was not the life for me nor the life I wanted my daughter to see me in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So we went back home to Iloilo and had my second job there, this time as a Search Engine Optimization Analyst. Fancy title, but all I did was search Google for stuff and write stuff for Google to digest. My boss’ site was built on WordPress and I created content for him. That was my first contact with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Working in that position for a few months bothered me, I know I am capable of more than just that (I am impatient and hard-headed and can’t keep my mouth shut – the perfect combination). So I read about web development. I didn’t know how to code – give me mathematical equations and I’ll solve it right away but all these HTML, CSS and whatnot were alien to me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I persevered, I never took a shortcut.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I studied for about a month and decided that I was ready. Plus, I’ve heard about this online job site where you can register to be a freelancer – it was quite new at that time but I gave it a go. If you’ve heard of oDesk (now Upwork), I was one of the first freelancers to join and I had the shirt to prove it. I don’t have the shirt now, but they sent it to me when they ran this contest for the freelancer with the longest work record.</p>\n<p>I applied to one job and one of the requirements was WordPress. I didn’t know WordPress aside from using it as a blog, and I know HTML/CSS (in theory). Lucky me, the client who eventually turned into my longest online friend, took a chance on me. I did not exactly tell him that I did not know WordPress, instead I told him what he wanted to hear – That <strong>I CAN DO IT</strong>. And I did. I worked on designing and developing his website while studying WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And that was when my love affair with WordPress started. I continued to learn and gain experience throughout the years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are <strong>NO SHORTCUTS</strong>. Believe me, I tried looking for one and I failed. In order to succeed, you have to work hard and not take the easy way out. Learn, read, listen – do this every single day for as long as you can.</p>\n<p>Although, my first client never really knew until now that I never had any idea what I was doing when I started working for him, I did get the job done (Dr. T, if you’re reading this – Thank you! I won’t say sorry, because that will denigrate all the things I’ve done and all the things I’ve learned over the years I was working with you). I persevered, I didn’t quit when the going got rough. Plus, WordPress has an amazing community and they are more than willing to help you out if you ever get stuck and I used them as a lifeline more times than I can remember.</p>\n<p>Let me say this again, it was not easy. I went through a lot. Moving forward, all of my clients were from abroad, most of them naturally assumed that I am male because of my name. And I think that contributed to how they were responding to my emails or chat.</p>\n<blockquote><p>They treated me as an equal and responded in a way they wouldn’t had they known I am female.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And once they knew, it was really hard for them to back out since they know that I am capable of getting the job done.</p>\n<p>I was brought up to always question the norm, to not back down simply because I am part of the so-called “weaker gender”. I speak my mind when I have to and when and where I choose to. Working in a male-dominated industry is pretty hard, gender bias is palpable in this industry. Plus, there are not a lot of women developers and that is really sad because without women – computing as we know it would not exist.</p>\n<p>You see, women have a harder time getting into the world of information technology because it has become male-dominated. I have a first-hand experience in this, imagine me – a woman, an Asian and a Filipino at that working in a space where men are the be-all end-all. I will say it again, it was not easy.</p>\n<p>Have you heard about the competence/likeability dilemma? The Heidi/Howard Roizen Case Study concluded that when women exhibit characteristics associated with leaders &#8211; like assertion, authority, and dominant behaviors &#8211; they tend to be disliked. Hence, women cannot be both competent and likeable.</p>\n<p>So according to this study: My competence is inversely proportional to my likeability. Meaning the more competent I am the less my colleagues like me. I may completely and vehemently disagree with this conclusion on a personal level, but there is truth to it. What can we do about this? I guess the first step is to acknowledge that it exists and work from there. But do not just be aware of the problem, acknowledge it and make a conscious effort to see when you are unconsciously adding to the problem and act on it. I don’t have a magic solution, what I can do is help empower girls to realize that they are stronger than they think they are and that they can do more. I did it without any shortcuts, I studied, I persevered, I worked my ass off to get where I am right now and I am not done yet. I still have to study, to preserve and to work every single day.</p>\n<p>My journey doesn’t end here, I still have a ways to go. I will continue to love what I do and I assure you, once you love what you do – you’ll work your ass off to make sure you continue to have and experience the joy of being able to do that thing that you love. Do not let your gender, your race or any of your biases define you. It is not a walk in the park, sure, but you have to always, always do your best to not regret doing something because you think you can’t. The only limit is YOU and nothing or no one else.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: There Are No Shortcuts\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=There%20Are%20No%20Shortcuts&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: There Are No Shortcuts\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F&title=There+Are+No+Shortcuts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/100318-min-150x150.jpg&description=There Are No Shortcuts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/\" title=\"There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/\">There Are No Shortcuts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"JC Palmes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"WPTavern: 5th Annual Hacktoberfest Kicks Off Today, Updated Rules Require 5 Pull Requests to Earn a T-shirt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84309\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://wptavern.com/5th-annual-hacktoberfest-kicks-off-today-updated-rules-require-5-pull-requests-to-earn-a-t-shirt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1555:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-10-01-at-5.58.26-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>DigitalOcean, along with GitHub and new partner Twilio, are sponsoring the <a href=\"https://blog.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-is-back-for-year-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5th annual Hacktoberfest</a>.

One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed.

The first edition of the camp was held in 2008 with 60 attendees. It was also the very first WordCamp in Japan.

Work on the 5.0 release may be ramping up sooner than expected after yesterday&#8217;s announcement that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-9-release-may-shift-focus-to-php-7-3-compatibility-gutenberg-merge-proposal-timeline-tbd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4.9.9 may be a quick release for PHP 7.3 compatibility</a> or possibly cancelled altogether.</p>\n<p>Themeforest, the largest marketplace for commercial WordPress themes with more than 11,000 products, has a specific <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/tags/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tag for Gutenberg-compatible theme listings</a>. Searching for themes that mention Gutenberg in the description turns up 139 products. But what does &#8220;Gutenberg compatible&#8221; mean?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-27-at-3.44.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg compatibility seems to be more of a buzzword among most of the Themeforest listings, indicating that the theme includes styles for all core blocks. However, in some instances theme authors have also tested shortcodes for compatibility with the new editor. A smaller number include access to premium blocks as part of their advertised Gutenberg compatibility.</p>\n<p>Searching the WordPress.org Theme Directory for &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/search/Gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg</a>&#8221; produces 26 results where compatibility is mentioned in the theme descriptions. Themes are noted to be &#8220;fully compatible&#8221; with Gutenberg or specifically &#8220;designed to work with the new editor.&#8221; There is a wide spectrum of interpretation on those selling points &#8211; from basic styles for core blocks to themes that explore all the possibilities that Gutenberg opens up with features created specifically for manipulation inside the new editor.</p>\n<p>Independent theme shops have been leading the charge in creating themes built to showcase what Gutenberg can do through pairing with plugins that offer block collections. Themes like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/editor-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Blocks</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> all have accompanying plugins that add custom blocks. This particular approach of packaging blocks into collections may not last very long, as it tends to make individual blocks more difficult to find.</p>\n<p>At the moment, advertising a theme as &#8220;Gutenberg compatible&#8221; is a temporary marketing strategy, as Gutenberg will soon lose its code name and become simply &#8220;the editor.&#8221; That special distinction will evaporate as soon as WordPress 5.0 lands. Gutenberg support will quickly become a matter of basic WordPress compatibility. The days of using it as a marketable feature are limited, and the pressure is on for theme developers to ensure their products are ready.</p>\n<p>In the video below, an excerpt from the &#8220;Theming with Gutenberg Course,&#8221; Zac Gordon examines considerations for theme developers who are working towards making their products compatible with the new editor. Gordon emphasizes that Gutenberg should work out of the box with any theme. However, there are a few features, such as the full width cover image, that may require special styles in order to work on the front end. The bulk of the compatibility work is ensuring that the editing experience matches the frontend and that Gutenberg blocks are styled harmoniously with the rest of the theme&#8217;s features.</p>\n<p>There are many tutorials available to help theme developers (and agencies preparing client sites) get started with making their themes ready for the Gutenberg era.

The company&#8217;s design team also packaged the algorithm as a web tool called <a href=\"https://www.colorbox.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ColorBox</a>. It makes it easy for anyone to produce color sets with accessible contrast ratios, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.0</a> standards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made accessibility a cornerstone of our new color system,&#8221; Lyft designer Kevyn Arnott said. &#8220;We wanted to remove the need to manually check color contrast using third-party tools, and we needed to make it dead-simple for everyone to create accessible products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arnott&#8217;s post &#8220;<a href=\"https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Re-approaching color</a>&#8221; describes how his team created the algorithm and why it was necessary. As Lyft&#8217;s design and engineering teams grew, it became apparent that color naming and selection was not consistent across their products. With thousands of people building products that rely on color, scaling a color system becomes vitally important.</p>\n<p>Lyft used what they had already done with color naming and selection and created an algorithm that would standardize the progression of lightness-to-darkness across color hues. The result is that every color 0–50 is accessible (4.5:1) on black and every color 60–100 is accessible (4.5:1) on white.</p>\n<p>ColorBox is a mesmerizing and powerful tool to play with. It has inputs for the number of steps, hue, saturation, and luminosity. Each input also comes with different preset curve options, offering greater control over how colors progress in hue and saturation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This algorithm allows us to remove all the dependencies we previously had with color selection, so if we have a new designer working on this or we change tools or monitors, we’ll still have the same outcome,&#8221; Arnott said. &#8220;This algorithm also enables us to quickly modify or scale color as we need to over time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many companies and open source projects seem to be short on accessibility experts, so a tool targeted at making accessible color systems more approachable is a welcome contribution.

This version will mark the project&#8217;s 40th release.</p>\n\n<p>Ventura outlined a number of tasks that have been completed up to this point. These include, Full Screen, Unified Toolbar, and Spotlight modes to adapt to a user’s creative preferences, adaptive design, and autosave support.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The list provides a great recap of the progress that&#8217;s been made since early 2017. Gutenberg 4.0 will initially be a release candidate that will be made available in the next few days. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; callout <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-8-released\">in WordPress 4.9.8</a> and the editor <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-is-slowly-rolling-out-to-wordpress-com-users\">slowly making its way</a> to sites on WordPress.com, the team has received a lot of feedback leading to improved iterations. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The main feature set <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4894\">targeted for the first version</a> of the editor has been considered complete for a few releases now,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Since then, however, the large amount of testing being carried out and the great feedback coming from multiple venues has resulted in several further iterations and additions to continue to improve the overall experience to wider satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This includes things like editor modes and tweaks to the inserter, transformation, and toolbar mechanisms. That has pushed us back a little in being able to fully focus on bug fixing.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>With the initial feature set complete and the WordPress 5.0 release cycle <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-9-release-may-shift-focus-to-php-7-3-compatibility-gutenberg-merge-proposal-timeline-tbd\">about to begin</a>, a merge proposal appears imminent even though specific timelines <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">have yet to be determined</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 23:26:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.9 Release May Shift Focus to PHP 7.3 Compatibility, Gutenberg Merge Proposal Timeline TBD\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-9-release-may-shift-focus-to-php-7-3-compatibility-gutenberg-merge-proposal-timeline-tbd\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3553:\"<p>The plans for WordPress 4.9.9 are currently in limbo after today&#8217;s core developers&#8217; chat. Here&#8217;s what we know right now: Discussions are underway regarding making it a quick PHP 7.3 compatibility release or cancelling it in favor of moving ahead with the 5.0 release cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Progress and communication on 4.9.9 has been very vague as of late, and I apologize for that,&#8221; WordPress 4.9.9 release co-lead Alain Schlesser said. &#8220;There were things that needed to be clarified first, but we can now finally share the big news with you: It&#8217;s just about time to begin work on the 5.0 release cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of this, @antpb and I will step back as release leads and we&#8217;ll wind down the 4.9.9 release. Over the next couple of weeks we will start coordinating the transition to ease into this major release cycle. This includes going through the hard work that teams are already in the middle of and planning how best to proceed. As we&#8217;ll figure out the next steps and the best path forward, we&#8217;ll share further details in future updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After Schlesser&#8217;s announcement, there was some discussion about whether or not 4.9.9 is still needed, but the matter seemed to be already settled. Josepha Haden, who leads the open source teams at Automattic as a full-time sponsored volunteer on the WordPress project, is assisting in transitioning important items from the 4.9.9 release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we all know that a lot of work has gone into 4.9.9 planning already,&#8221; Haden said. &#8220;So the next couple of weeks will be all about reaching out to team reps and discussing what you&#8217;ve been working on and what we can do to keep things moving forward for everyone. But I will probably be helping with the 4.9.9 transition things, and I will say that the final timelines will almost certainly will be contingent on what I hear from team reps who were collaborating on 4.9.9.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haden confirmed that Schlesser was sharing the overall plan for the release but that feedback from the discussions indicated there may be items with earlier deadlines to consider. After gathering information from the team representatives, they will work to prioritize items that may need to land before 5.0. There may be time for a tightly-focused 4.9.9 release aimed solely at PHP 7.3 compatibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it will be possible to wrangle a small 4.9.9 release with PHP 7.3 related bug fixes, while 5.0 is ramping up,&#8221; Gary Pendergast commented during the meeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given a good part of 4.9.9&#8217;s focus was on supporting things for Gutenberg, not sure we &#8216;need a 4.9.9 release if we would just include the work done to support Gutenberg with the Gutenberg merge proposal coming for 5.0,&#8221; Jeff Paul said. Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura confirmed that the plugin is ready for the team to begin collaborating on a merge proposal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have kept development in the plugin for as long as possible for speed / convenience, etc, but it’s been ready for starting 5.0 process for a bit,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;From the Gutenberg side, things should be ready to start planning the merge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the moment, a quick 4.9.9 release is under consideration for PHP 7.3-related bug fixes. It may happen while the gears are in motion for 5.0 or it may yet be cancelled in favor of going full speed ahead with the 5.0 release cycle. The decision has not yet been officially announced.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 22:29:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: The Hero’s Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://heropress.com/the-heros-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-heros-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3427:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100516-2-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: We cannot know the end of any journey until we find ourselves there.\" /><p>A couple years ago I noticed that someone had done a talk at WordCamp Brighton called &#8220;<a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/08/09/tamsin-taylor-a-heros-journey/\">The Hero&#8217;s Journey</a>&#8220;. As you can imagine it immediately caught my eye and I went hunting to find this cool person.  As it turns out it was Tamsin Taylor from Brighton and she had a great story. As I was re-reading it today I was struck by her point that great things are built from the foundation of many smaller things. Experience comes from years of simply doing. Maturity comes from years of growing. Heroism comes from many small acts of goodness.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a journey involved in every destination. We face hardship, struggle, pain, and growth, and at the end we&#8217;re a different person in a different place.

Since that time a new tech team has taken over the project to further the mission of finding and indexing all 1.4 billion+ CC-licensed works on the web.</p>\n<p>The first iteration added access to images from Rijksmuseum, Flickr, 500px, the New York Public Library, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2018/09/24/big-changes-for-cc-search-beta-updates-released-today/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> to the search tool adds access to more than 10 million images and a total of 13 content providers, including Behance, Geograph UK, IHA Holiday Ads, several other museums, and a handful of smaller sources.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/screencapture-ccsearch-creativecommons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The search page is also sporting a new design, featuring Creative Commons&#8217; top categories and top images.</p>\n<p>Previously, search results were displayed as a masonry style grid, supporting images of varying sizes and orientations. The updated results are displayed as a slice of a landscape-oriented image on mobile and desktop, which is not optimal for seeing what the image is without clicking on it. This doesn&#8217;t seem like an improvement, but the search tool&#8217;s development team is still working through bugs and the site is in active development.</p>\n<p>This update to the search tool also adds AI image tags generated by <a href=\"https://clarifai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Clarifai</a>&#8216;s image classification system. More than 10.3 million images have been tagged using the image recognition software, in addition to the user-defined and platform-defined tags gathered from web crawl data. This should make the search results more accurate for users in the future.</p>\n<p>Lists and collections were a feature of the first beta but private lists are no longer available in the beta update. (Users can request they be manually retrieved by emailing Creative Commons.) The feature has been updated to allow users to create public lists of images without having an account. A new shares.cc link shortening system is now available for sharing images and lists.</p>\n<p>The Creative Commons library is an excellent resource for finding images for blogging or for use in WordPress theme and plugin development. Images that are CC0-licensed are GPL-compatible for use within WordPress products.

The templates can also be exported and imported as a JSON file.</p>\n<p>The idea of reusable templates is an expansion of the concept of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1516\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic reusable blocks</a> that Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura proposed in June 2017. Reusability is even more powerful when applied to multiple blocks. The import/export capabilities make it possible for templates to be easily shared across WordPress sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-24-at-1.04.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to test it, you can select multiple blocks by selecting the content inside a block and dragging outside the boundaries of the block to extend the selection to multiple blocks. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/62\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">multi-select feature</a> was originally added for the purpose of deleting or moving multiple blocks but it has now become indispensable for creating reusable templates.</p>\n<p>This feature lays the ground work for a full-fledged layout builder in the next phase of Gutenberg development. Reusable templates should make it a breeze to build WordPress sites with pre-defined layouts that users and developers can share. They are much more intuitive to implement than page templates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holy wow, imagine this: wp-blueprints.com, where people can group blocks together and share their JSON strings with nice little copy buttons,&#8221; Gutenberg designer Joen Asmussen commented on the PR. &#8220;Categories for top rated, most downloaded, search, etc? This is going to happen because of this magic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matias Ventura&#8217;s demo video shows the reusable templates in action. It also highlights a new tool for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/7995\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">visually comparing possible ways to convert an invalid block</a>. The editor now includes a diff UI for blocks, which Ventura said could possibly scale in the future to provide an improved UX for revisions as a whole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A few other notable additions in the 3.9 release include improvements to the drag and drop handle, collapsible groups for the block toolbar, and the ability to convert a cover image block to an image and back. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9683\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dark editor style support</a> is now available for theme developers, making Gutenberg more friendly for use with dark WordPress themes.

Last year <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/blog/jsdelivr-reloaded-2017/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jsDelivr was revamped</a> to allow any file from GitHub and npm to be served by the CDN. WordPress&#8217; mirror on GitHub made it possible for Dinić to create a plugin that works with the CDN.</p>\n<p>commonWP aims to speed up performance by offloading JavaScript and CSS files to jsDelivr, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All files from WordPress core (unless development version of WordPress is in use)</li>\n<li>All files from plugins hosted by WordPress.org Plugins Repository (unless author of specific plugin doesn’t use SVN tags for releasing)</li>\n<li>All files from themes hosted by WordPress.org Themes Repository</li>\n<li>All files from plugins and themes hosted on GitHub that support GitHub Updater</li>\n<li>All files marked as available on npm in any type of theme, plugin, or MU plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dinić said he designed commonWP with a emphasis on keeping it lightweight, easy-to-use, and secure. He claims the approach he used in the plugin is safer than any other plugin that employs a CDN for WordPress files:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, commonWP will only rewrite file to point to one on jsDelivr if that remote file is identical to local one. Second, during comparison, it generates <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subresource identity hash</a> of remote jsDelivr file and includes that hash in page’s source code so browser won’t load remote file if it doesn’t have exactly the same hash.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dinić recommends the plugin for users who are not already using a CDN, have limited budgets, or live in less developed countries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a CDN is generally recommended, and with this one they might get even more speed because some files might be already cached by their visitors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine if jquery.js, jquery-migrate.min.js (most common files) are always served from one place. You wouldn&#8217;t need to get them from each WordPress site you visit. You would get them once and they would be in your browser&#8217;s cache, and initial page load would be faster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dinić referenced a Trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44229\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> where using a CDN is proposed for serving assets like jQuery, but no action has been taken on the proposal yet. One benefit he cites for WordPress&#8217; global user base is that a CDN like jsDelivr allows visitors to get files from their own content, country, or even the same city. jsDelivr has a large multi-CDN network with infrastructure built on top of other networks, including StackPath, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Quantil. It also has custom servers in locations like China where other public CDNs have little or no presence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-21-at-2.39.40-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>commonWP doesn&#8217;t have any settings for users to configure. The plugin fills up its cache in the background after it is activated. Developers can fine tune it for their needs and Dinić has published some <a href=\"https://github.com/dimadin/commonWP#marking-files-that-exist-in-npm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">code examples</a> to GitHub.</p>\n<p>In his release <a href=\"https://milandinic.com/2018/09/18/introducing-commonwp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>, Dinić referenced a Serbian site getting a 1-second loading improvement and has done other tests but said he&#8217;s still looking for a good way to present the data. The plugin&#8217;s FAQ outlines which factors influence whether or not commonWP can bring performance improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many of your files are available on jsDelivr and can be rewritten &#8211; the more files on jsDelivr, the more speed; the more files used by the page are rewritten to jsDelivr, the more speed.</li>\n<li>The further your site&#8217;s visitors are from the server your site is hosted on, the more speed you can get.</li>\n<li>The slower your server is, the more speed it can get.</li>\n<li>If your visitors already visited WordPress site(s) with commonWP activated, there is more chance that some of the files you use on your site are already cached by them so they can get more speed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every site will see drastic improvements for site owners testing performance, but visitors from other parts of the world may be able to load certain files faster. Dinić recommends users test their sites using webpagetest.org and select a higher number of tests to get an average. He also recommends testing with different locations and different connection speeds. Test with the plugin activated and deactivated and when the site has a full cache. In general, the further the location is from the server and the larger number of files sent to jsDelivr, the bigger the performance improvement will be.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 20:19:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Gutenstats Blog Is Live, Tracking Gutenberg Beta Testing Data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84153\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenstats-blog-is-live-tracking-gutenberg-beta-testing-data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1455:\"<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1042901193679241216\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> out a link to <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenstats.blog</a> this evening, a new site dedicated to tracking Gutenberg beta testing data.

These numbers were collected from posts made on WordPress.com and Jetpack sites since late August 2018 and a note on the site says the actual number is higher.</p>\n<p>In June, Mullenweg unveiled a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for Gutenberg to land in WordPress 5.0</a>.

The announcement coincides with International Talk Like a Pirate Day but the pirate branding of the plugin is set to be retired and its users will be given the option to migrate to WPForms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pirate-forms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pirate Forms</a> was purchased in what WPForms co-founder and CEO Syed Balkhi describes as &#8220;an all-cash deal.&#8221; Although the plugin currently has more than 300,000 users on WordPress.org, its features and capabilities are inferior to the more modern WPForms and its creators lacked the resources to bring it up to speed.</p>\n<p>Pirate Forms had gained popularity in its earlier days by providing a simple forms plugin (without all the builder functions) for sites that required just one contact form.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where most of the other plugins aim at &#8216;mega functionality&#8217; with tons of customizations, add-ons and whatnots, Pirate Forms has made a bet on simplicity,&#8221; ThemeIsle representative Karol K said in the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/pirate-forms-is-now-wpforms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">farewell post</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In other words, it just works(ed) right after the installation, with no particular setup required (other than adding your form to a contact page). This was a nice refreshment compared to the usual &#8216;get through tons of onboarding wizard screens before you can use the plugin&#8217; -approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pirate Forms could no longer deliver what users expect from a forms plugin in 2018 and ThemeIsle opted to find a buyer in order to free up resources to focus on releasing the <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/hestia-2-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hestia 2.0</a> theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This acquisition further strengthens WPForms&#8217; position in the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; Balkhi said. The expectation is that a large number of users will migrate their forms to WPForms as the result of Pirate Forms discontinuing active development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-move-from-pirate-forms-to-wpforms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A migration path to WPForms</a> is built into the latest version of Pirate Forms and Balkhi describes the process as a seamless transition. Users are also free to select another forms plugin but they will not have the benefit of the migration tool, which also imports the notification email and confirmation settings from users&#8217; existing forms. Those who have purchased Pirate Forms Pro will receive a free one-year license to WPForms Pro.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a> has more than 1 million active installs and currently maintains a 4.9 out of 5 star average rating on WordPress.org. The drag-and-drop WordPress form builder is much more advanced than Pirate Forms and the free version allows users to create contact forms, subscription forms, payment forms, offline forms, multi-page forms, and many other types of customized feedback mechanisms. It is also compatible with all of ThemeIsle&#8217;s themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 02:50:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Big Bite Creative to Launch New Amnesty International Website based on Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84074\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/big-bite-creative-launches-new-amnesty-international-website-based-on-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4776:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-10.39.11-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The team at <a href=\"http://bigbitecreative.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bite Creative</a> has developed a new website for Amnesty International using Gutenberg, soon to be launched at <a href=\"http://amnesty.eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">amnesty.eu</a>. The agency worked in partnership with <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com VIP</a> to provide the London-based human rights organization with the tools to create multiple sites that could be uniquely customized for their editorial needs.</p>\n<p>After successfully using Gutenberg to launch a site for an international bank, Big Bite CTO Jason Agnew said his team gained confidence to use the new editor for the Amnesty site. The client approached Bite Bite around the time of WordCamp Europe when Matt Mullenweg unveiled a roadmap for getting a stable Gutenberg release before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On top of this the Amnesty project suited Gutenberg,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;Their brief mentioned 14 components which could be used to build out multiple sites. I honestly think it would have been difficult to build something that required this level of flexibility with a field manager like Fieldmanager, CMB2 or ACF. Perhaps it would have been possible with page builders like Visual Composer, but these platforms are still figuring out how they will work with the WordPress 5.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through the use of a combination of prompts, custom blocks, nested blocks, and predefined styles, Big Bite made it possible for even non-technical editorial staff to create and arrange content to build out websites for various outreach locations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been fascinating to give the client full control over the site structure compared to the more traditional development of templates,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;We are still in the early stages of launching sites with the new platform, but the client has built up the EU site on their own without much support, which should be going live early October. Now they are in the process building out websites for Mali and Iran, with the goal to launch around 20 sites initially. We&#8217;ve had the editorial team describe the experience as fun &#8211; that&#8217;s from a team who have used WordPress with ACF in the past, which does offer an intuitive UI but still requires a level of training of what fields relate to what pieces of content on the front-end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As many others have reported, one of the most challenging things Big Bite encountered in extending Gutenberg was the project&#8217;s incomplete documentation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had our challenges, and particularly the Gutenberg documentation is not up to standard, which leads to a lot of time being wasted,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;But I have to say once our team get over the first block or two it wasn&#8217;t an issue. It&#8217;s important to say that the Gutenberg team Slack have been a great help when we did run into problems. We did discover IE11 support is still a work in progress, for example, copy &amp; paste didn&#8217;t work, meta boxes wouldn&#8217;t render causing saving issues with posts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Agnew said for most issues there isn&#8217;t a lot one can do to resolve them apart from waiting for each update as the plugin improves, but it&#8217;s something agencies need to account for when working with clients. The Big Bite team also found that Gutenberg compatibility is still an issue for many of the plugins that they looked at using for the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apart from using Yoast we&#8217;ve mainly custom built the theme due to many plugins still requiring UI changes to work well with Gutenberg,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;Probably the most significant feature we wrote was language syndication system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Big Bite plans to open source Amnesty International&#8217;s full theme, which includes all of the custom blocks. Prior to that they are going to remove all the branding to avoid lots of new sites popping looking like the Amnesty brand. The agency is aiming for publishing the code the same day as WordPress 5.0 is released or earlier if the release is delayed beyond January.</p>\n<p>For a closer look at the Amnesty International project, check out Big Bite&#8217;s announcement <a href=\"https://bigbitecreative.com/investing-gutenberg-amnesty-international/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>.

Since the blocks are JavaScript-only, they would work across both Drupal and WordPress alike, so developers can build for both platforms simultaneously. The Gutenberg Cloud creators are aiming to facilitate a new level of cross-platform sharing that few envisioned when the Gutenberg project began.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg to us is much more than just another module,&#8221; Frontkom CIO Per André Rønsen said during their presentation at Drupal Europe. &#8220;We think of it as a platform for brand new features. We are very excited about the sharing/community aspect and the possibilities here. We want to make it easy to share and reuse custom blocks across pages, across projects, across companies, and even across publishing platforms. Drupal has always been great at sharing backend style of code. Now let&#8217;s make it great at sharing frontend code as well. This is why we&#8217;re working on a block managing system.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gutenberg-cloud.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg Cloud would provide a plugin for WordPress and a module for Drupal (and eventually other applications) that would enable users to browse, filter, and discover blocks within the admin and download the ones they select. Early mockups I previewed show an interface similar to the theme and plugin browsers inside the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>A cloud-based block service solves a few problems that Gutenberg early adopters are already experiencing when hunting for blocks. WordPress theme and plugin shops have have been releasing their own block collections bundled into a plugin, but it&#8217;s not easy to discover or browse the individual blocks. Having blocks available on Gutenberg Cloud would prevent developers from having to create a new module or plugin for each individual block. It also prevents users from having to download an entire collection of blocks in a plugin when they really only need one or two of them.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Cloud Will Launch as a Community Project, Developers Contribute by Publishing Packages to NPM</h3>\n<p>Rønsen said they plan to launch Gutenberg Cloud as a community project. Any developer can contribute blocks by creating an NPM package and tagging it with &#8220;gutenberg-cloud.&#8221; The description on the cloud service outlines their intentions: &#8220;Code once, use everywhere: As Gutenberg blocks are CMS-agnostic, we want to provide an ecosystem all systems can connect to.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-3.39.54-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>An example Hero section block published to NPM\n<p>&#8220;We imagine everything from freelancers to big agencies and even community minded non-profits to contribute,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;When people benefit from a better user experience, they tend to want to pay it forward. We have already talked to people in both communities wanting to contribute with code, so that is a great start for the platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked if his team envisions block creators being able to sell access to their blocks in the future. He said his team is open to finding a payment solution for commercial blocks but only if the community demands it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I would be skeptical about committing to a community project that had a very commercial edge,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important that the project stays focused on open source contributions, with a sharing-is-caring attitude. It&#8217;s the only language we know in Drupal. However, there is nothing wrong in providing high quality content and getting paid to do it. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s on our roadmap to facilitate a payment solution for premium blocks – if the community wants it. It&#8217;s not central to the success of the platform, but I imagine it could be a great way to make some money for a skilled designer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen said his team plans to launch Gutenberg Cloud sometime later this year after completing internal testing and an invitation-only closed beta with a different companies. One of the most challenging aspect of the project is creating a system that can handle updates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By default users will get the latest stable release for the block from the author,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;There will be a way to lock into a specific version and to version control that in Git, however. The plugin update system is a good analogy, but the infrastructure is completely outside of WordPress core. There are also some issues we haven’t solved yet regarding updates; it’s hard to make a system that doesn’t require a high maintenance effort for block developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg Cloud project is contingent upon Gutenberg development continuing on a path towards being a library that is decoupled from WordPress. Last week Rønsen <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-gutenberg-project-receives-enthusiastic-reception-at-drupal-europe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the Tavern that his team hopes &#8220;that Gutenberg core devs will catch onto the vision of Gutenberg as the ‘editor for the open web’ — not just for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg team member Gary Pendergast indirectly acknowledged this in a recent blog <a href=\"https://pento.net/2018/09/16/the-mission-democratise-publishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> that affirmed the Drupal Gutenberg project and reiterated WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the primary philosophies of Gutenberg’s technical architecture is platform agnosticism, and we can see the practical effects of this practice coming to fruition across a variety of projects,&#8221; Pendergast said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From early experiments in running the block editor as a standalone application, to being able to compile it into a native mobile component, and now seeing it running on Drupal, Gutenberg’s technical goals have always included a radical level of platform agnosticism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Drupal community ends up adopting Gutenberg for its core editor, the shared library presents an unprecedented opportunity for deeper collaboration across the two publishing platforms. As an agency that has done client work for publishers on both CMSs, Frontkom saw the potential before many others and took it upon themselves to fork Gutenberg for Drupal. This is the beauty of open source software in action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has many advantages that make it so popular, but hoarding those to ourselves doesn’t help the open web, it just creates more silos,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;The open web is the only platform on which publishing can be democratized, so it makes sense for Gutenberg to work anywhere on the open web, not just inside WordPress. Drupal isn’t a competitor here, we’re all working towards the same goal, the different paths we’ve taken have made the open web stronger as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen said he could see other applications and e-commerce platforms like Magento benefitting from better page-building tools. His company has a special interest in publishers and plans to release a set of open source tools for building news front pages later in 2018. Rønsen said he is hopeful the Drupal Gutenberg project can evolve alongside WordPress as it enters into the site building and customization phase of the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that the Gutenberg project will stay decoupled from WP one way or another,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;This will leave room for Drupal to innovate on top of it. It could even be the case that the page building tools and customizer integration in WP will play nicely into the current architecture. In any case, I believe the basics of the editor and block concept will continue to be a good fit for Drupal. There is already some consensus out there on how to use Gutenberg for page building. A great example, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgF5ImDlCTw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bite&#8217;s work with Amnesty</a>. If the continued experience is anything like that, I think we have a perfect match.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:38:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: CEOs and the Real World\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48345\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2018/09/ceos-and-the-real-world/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4867:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The downside of Zuckerberg’s exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year’s resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a “listening tour” that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family’s philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, “When a politician goes to one of those, it’s an hour, and they’re talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.”</p><p>But the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, “No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There seem to be three communication gaps outlined here in Evan Osnos&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy\">revealing profile of Mark Zuckerberg</a>: one is getting unvarnished feedback from your employees. Speaking as a fellow CEO and founder, it&#8217;s certainly hard to pop that bubble &#8212; see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxAVusStCg\">&#8220;the bear is sticky with honey.&#8221;</a> There are a few techniques like skip-level 1:1 meetings, anonymous feedback forms, interviewing new hires, and 360 reviews you can do to try to counter this, but there&#8217;s no panacea and this one requires constant work as you scale.</p>\n\n<p>The second gap is getting the unvarnished truth from your users &#8212; much easier, as they&#8217;re quite happy to tell you what&#8217;s what. I&#8217;ve recently started cold-calling (yes, on the phone!) some of our Jetpack customers just to understand what they love and don&#8217;t love about the experience and about how we can help them solve their business challenges. There&#8217;s a casual intimacy to phone conversations that just can&#8217;t be replicated in other user feedback forums. Pair this with good instrumentation throughout your product so you see what people do and not just what they say and you&#8217;re golden.</p>\n\n<p>The third and last communication gap is the connection to the world as most people experience it. If your status, wealth, or celebrity reach a point that they are shutting you out from &#8220;real&#8221; experiences, take some risks and get outside of your comfort zone. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/the-untold-stories-of-paul-mccartney\">this new GQ profile of Paul McCartney offered a tip on that: </a></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>McCartney tells me a further such story of a time he took the Hampton Jitney, the slightly upmarket bus service that runs from the Hamptons into Manhattan, because he was deep into Charles Dickens&#8217;s Nicholas Nickleby and he wanted to finish it, and how he then took a local bus uptown, and when a woman blurted from across the bus, &#8220;Hey! Are you Paul McCartney?&#8221; he invited her to sit next to him and chatted all the way uptown. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way of not worrying about your fame,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way of not turning into the reclusive rock star. I often say to Nancy: I get in their faces before they get a chance to get in mine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Makes me wonder if <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/jack-dorsey-bus-bubble/\">Jack Dorsey still rides the bus to work every day</a>. I think this is what Zuckerberg was attempting with his 30-state tour, and hopefully it was helpful even if the optics didn&#8217;t appeal to everyone — the daily habit of his 2013 resolution to meet someone new every day feels more powerful than the touristic 30-state one. But for an entity as large as Facebook maybe it&#8217;s moot, as Casey Newton pointed out <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/the-trouble-with-mark-zuckerberg-profiles-133299\">in his newsletter last week</a> it can be quite hard to pin the answers to Facebook&#8217;s real problems, and our democracy&#8217;s real challenges <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/09/responsibility-of-technology/\">in the face of targeted online propaganda</a>, to just one person.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:35:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Hybrid Core 5.0 Offers a More Modern, Modular Approach to WordPress Theme Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-5-0-offers-a-more-modern-modular-approach-to-wordpress-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3877:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/coffee-computer.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/JFPYO9HEZR\">Shopify</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-5-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 5.0</a> of Hybrid Core, one of the longest-running WordPress theme frameworks, is now available. Justin Tadlock celebrated 10 years with his Theme Hybrid community last month and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mythic-a-wordpress-starter-theme-by-justin-tadlock-now-in-open-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released his new Mythic starter theme into beta</a>. Mythic was built on top of Hybrid Core and developed in tandem with version 5.0.</p>\n<p>The framework has been rewritten almost entirely from scratch to be a leaner, more modern starting place for theme development. Tadlock describes it as &#8220;a fundamentally different framework, rewritten from the ground up, that supports more modern PHP practices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started 5.0 with a goal of bringing the framework up to date with more modern PHP practices and code,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first iteration of the framework was built in 2008, so it was time to get us ready for the next era of theme building.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In nearly a decade of supporting the framework, Tadlock found that users didn&#8217;t always know how to get started building something from scratch. Many copied one of his existing themes and would add and remove things from it based on their own needs.</p>\n<p>Version 5.0 doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it easier to build on top of Hybrid Core with its new, more complicated method of bootstrapping, new <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/working-with-the-view-class\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">view system for templating</a>, and requirement for using <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a>. This is why Tadlock is officially recommending <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/themes/mythic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mythic</a> as the path for building a theme with Hybrid Core in the future. Most of the documentation and tutorials he plans to create in the future will be centered around the Mythic starter theme, which is nearing a 1.0 release.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We just closed all tickets on the 1.0.0 milestone for the Mythic starter theme! It feels pretty good.</p>\n<p>Barring any OMGBBQ issues between now and tomorrow, you should see an announcement post from me.<a href=\"https://t.co/J4CGLKa1y5\">https://t.co/J4CGLKa1y5</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Justin Tadlock (@justintadlock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1041808697813598208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>For many theme developers, Mythic&#8217;s use of the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) CSS class-naming system is their first introduction to a system of non-hierarchal, component-based CSS. Because BEM doesn&#8217;t rely on nested selectors, it&#8217;s easier for users to overwrite CSS that they want to change. Tadlock explains the benefit for child themes in a recent post about <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/why-mythic-uses-bem\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">why Mythic uses BEM</a>.</p>\n<p>A handful of the Hybrid add-ons are now available as Composer packages, including one for breadcrumbs, customizer controls and settings, Google fonts, and a featured image script. Tadlock plans to split more parts of the framework off into packages in the future for an increasingly modular core.</p>\n<p>Hybrid Core 5.0 requires PHP 5.6+ (with 7.0+ recommended) and WordPress 4.9.6+. Tadlock will support Hybrid Core&#8217;s 4.x series for at least another year to give theme authors time to adapt.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 04:07:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Yoast SEO 8.2 Adds How-To and FAQ Gutenberg Blocks with Structured Data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83822\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-8-2-adds-how-to-and-faq-gutenberg-blocks-with-structured-data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2422:\"<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO 8.2</a> was released last week with the plugin&#8217;s first tools designed specifically for Gutenberg.

Gutenberg and Calypso are large JavaScript applications, built with strong opinions on design direction and technical architecture, and having <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/27034\">significant component overlap</a>. That these two projects can function together at all is something of an obscure engineering feat that&#8217;s both difficult and overwhelming to appreciate.</p>\n\n<p>If we reached the limit of Gutenberg&#8217;s platform agnosticism here, it would still be a successful project.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not where the ultimate goals of the Gutenberg project stand. From <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/standalone-gutenberg\">early experiments</a> in running the block editor as a <a href=\"https://gutenberg-standalone.surge.sh/\">standalone application</a>, to being able to compile it into a <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile\">native mobile component</a>, and now seeing it <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\">running on Drupal</a>, Gutenberg&#8217;s technical goals have always included a radical level of platform agnosticism.</p>\n\n<h2>Better Together</h2>\n\n<p>Inside the WordPress world, significant effort and focus has been on ensuring backwards compatibility with existing WordPress sites, plugins, and practices. Given that WordPress is such a hugely popular platform, it&#8217;s exceedingly important to ensure this is done right. With Gutenberg expanding outside of the WordPress world, however, we&#8217;re seeing different focuses and priorities arise.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gutenbergcloud.org/\">Gutenberg Cloud</a> service is a fascinating extension being built as part of the Drupal Gutenberg project, for example. It provides a method for new blocks to be shared and discovered, the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontkom/g-hero-section\">sample hero block</a> sets a clear tone of providing practical components that can be rapidly put together into a full site. While we&#8217;ve certainly seen similar services appear for the various site builder plugins, this is the first one (that I&#8217;m aware of, at least) build specifically for Gutenberg.</p>\n\n<p>By making the Gutenberg experience available for everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, experience, or even <em>preferred platform</em>, we pave the way for a better future for all.</p>\n\n<h2>Democratising Publishing</h2>\n\n<p>You might be able to guess where this is going. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; mission is to &#8220;democratise publishing&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t to &#8220;be the most popular CMS&#8221;, or to &#8220;run on old versions of PHP&#8221;, though it&#8217;s easy to think that might be the case on the surface. That these statements are true is simply a side effect of the broader principle: All people, regardless of who they are or where they come from, should be able to publish their content as part of a free and open web.</p>\n\n<p>The WordPress mission is not to &#8220;democratise publishing with WordPress&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>WordPress has many advantages that make it so popular, but hoarding those to ourselves doesn&#8217;t help the open web, it just creates more silos. The open web is the only platform on which publishing can be democratised, so it makes sense for Gutenberg to work anywhere on the open web, not just inside WordPress. Drupal isn&#8217;t a competitor here, we&#8217;re all working towards the same goal, the different paths we&#8217;ve taken have made the open web stronger as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Much as the block editor has been the first practical implementation of the Gutenberg architecture, WordPress is simply the first practical integration of the block editor into a CMS. The Gutenberg project will expand into site customisation and theming next, and while there&#8217;s no requirement that Drupal make use of these, I&#8217;d be very interested to see what they came up with if they did. Bringing together our many years of experience in tackling these complex problems can only make the end result better.</p>\n\n<p>I know I&#8217;m looking forward to all of us working together for the betterment of the open web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 04:48:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.8 Released, Adds Full Screen Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-8-released-adds-full-screen-mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2254:\"<p>Gutenberg 3.8 is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">available for download</a>.

Unlike previous versions of Distraction-Free-Writing mode where things would fade in and out of view, these two items stay hidden until full-screen mode is disabled.</p>\n\n<p>User Interface elements have been added to manage reusable blocks in bulk. Theme authors are now able to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9008\">register editor styles</a> for blocks by targeting the blocks themselves. This avoids combating CSS specificity and doesn&#8217;t require knowledge of the internal DOM structure for the editor. </p>\n\n<p>The block settings icon has been moved from the right side of blocks to the toolbar. This change sets the foundation for refactoring the toolbar and it reduces clutter by keeping the icons together.<br /></p>\n\n<img />Block Settings Moved to The Right Side of The Toolbar\n\n<p>Gutenberg 3.8 also contains a significant increase in performance thanks to a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8083\">hand-coded default</a> block parser. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Having a formal specification of the Gutenberg block grammar has allowed us both to maintain a stable core during the almost 40 releases of the plugin and lately to allow competing parser implementation to evolve and be compared in terms of performance and correctness. </p><p>In concrete terms, we are shipping <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8083\">a new default implementation</a> that is hundreds of times faster than the spec and has been stress tested with really long posts (including Moby Dick). These tests are also available for anyone to run against. Memory consumption has also gone down dramatically for server side operations.
